# TL;DR (Too Long Didn't Read)

* Grace: You are enough. God is enough.
* LET GOD LOVE YOU, LIVE LOVED, LEARN TO LOVE GOD by seeking what matters to God on this earth (Kingdom) and consider God's way of doing things (righteousness). "Seeking the Kingdom of God" is not a religious act. It's a RELATIONAL enterprise. It's an attitude of vulnerability. No religion can teach you that.

# Your Purpose

**There are no accidents in God's universe, Friend**

**Everything, is either caused by God, or allowed by God. You either believe in the supreme, unlimited, power of God or not! You either believe that when you surrender to God, He takes over totally, or you live with a part-time God the rest of your life.**

Our human understanding has a limited comprehension of such God, who loves, cares, produces miracles, intervenes, protects, allows painful experiences to happen.

**"Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. BUT ONE THING I DO: FORGETTING WHAT IS BEHIND AND STRAINING TOWARD WHAT IS AHEAD, I PRESS ON TOWARD the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus."** Philippians 3:13-14 (NIV)

Forgetting the **PAST,** looking **FORWARD,** I **PRESS ON.** Can you feel the force behind these words, Friend? Total focus. Total singleness of mind and purpose. Only **ONE THING** matters: To press on!

Let your entire life be rooted in God. Question everything with the eyes of one who knows God. Check everything through the filters of God's presence in the here and now. Accept everything in faith, believing that somehow there is a reason for such event. Romans 8:28 holds the key to the best life ever! Nothing in life gets better than trusting in God.

**"And we know that all things work out for good for those who love God."**

This promise does not say, that everything in life will be pleasant. This is not an unconditional promise, either. It only applies to followers of God. This promise is for those who believe God is powerful to turn an ugly divorce into a better life. This promise is for parents who suffer for the life a child has chosen to live. God will bring gold out of the fire. This promise is for those who believe God can turn ashes into beauty. This promise is for those who believe their mistakes, sins, a horrible, painful past, can be turn into a blessing to bless others.

“Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. **YOU HAVE TO LOVE. YOU HAVE TO FEEL. IT IS THE REASON YOU ARE HERE ON EARTH. YOU ARE HERE TO RISK YOUR HEART.** You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.” (**"_The Painted Drum_"** by Louise Erdrich)

The Bible says that your heavenly Father has a plan for each of our individual lives (FathersLoveLetter.com). To fulfill that plan is nothing less than ultimate success in life. But we need to hear Him, so that He can lead us into His plan for our lives. But to do that, we need to be connected to Him through a personal loving relationship.

God loves you with an everlasting love and wants to bless you and fellowship with you! 

But Christ proved God’s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly! (Romans 5:8, TPT)

Why should you care? Well, because deep down you know you are accountable to God because God has placed the desire for love and eternity in every heart.

God has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart (Ecc. 3:11, NLT)

Jesus Christ not only loves you and proved it but also claimed to be I AM, the one and only Living God.

>You will never get greater satisfaction that to become a seeker of God... a seeker of His love... a seeker of the principles that govern His Kingdom!

God tells us in Jeremiah 29:13, **"And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart." If you are also a true seeker, if you want to know the true God, then He will reveal himself to you too.**

**God uses all kinds of vessels to reveal His glory** — big vessels and little vessels, ornate vessels and plain vessels, very expensive ones and very ordinary ones. They all serve a purpose!

**God wants to do something great with your life in the near future.** Did you know that? He wants to use the **"Gospel according to Friend"** and tell people about His power to transform. He wants you to be His story to the people of your world.

Two things are required:

**1) Honesty. Own your world. Own the dark part of your life. Stand up and say to yourself: I am responsible for everything I am feeling right now.** In the name of Jesus, I will stop blaming people. I will stop victimizing myself. **I will ask God to overcome the demonic forces that have been keeping me chained to my past!** I will stop feeling shameful, guilty, and I will assume responsibility for everything that happened in my life... Whether I was guilty or not. Over! New page. New chapter. I got God, the Creator of the universe, on my side!

**2) Surrender your past to God. Everything. Your sins. Your mistakes. Your sins of omission and commission. The people who hurt you. The people you hurt. SURRENDER ALL TO HIM** Go ask people forgiveness in the power of God. Dial that number and call. Go knock on a door. Tell people, **"I am sorry. I hurt you. Would you forgive me? I want to live for God from now on."** The bible calls that act, **confession.** Confession is the act of giving to God all the bad stuff you have done. Confession means asking people forgiveness for sinning against them. Confession gives you a new chapter. Confession means you have nothing to hide. You are a clean vessel. Confession means **YOU TRUST GOD!**

Augustine once said, **“The confession of bad works is the beginning of good works.” We start by dealing with our past. The Bible says,** “If we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do right: he will forgive us our sins and PURIFY us from all our wrongdoing” (1 John 1:9 TEV).


**YOUR CHOICES DETERMINE YOUR POTENTIAL**. Here is the key to the best **CHOICES** of your life: GOD'S PURPOSE FOR YOU! I have found out that there are different **quality** of choices people make. The best **quality** is born in the soil of people who have **CHOSEN** God's purpose. Their choices seem to reflect the heart of God. Love and commitment to people above their convenience. Service to others above financial gain. A readiness to stand for God at the expense of popularity. A choice to the fresh revelation of God's will instead of the stale predicaments of irrelevant religion. Whatever you are facing right now, friend, **MAKE A CHOICE.** Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God's purpose! If you don't know what's God's purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one **CHOICE** that will transform your life forever! And it is not RELIGION! Whatever you are facing right now, friend, **MAKE A CHOICE.** Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God's purpose! If you don't know what's God's purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one **CHOICE** that will transform your life forever! 

> There is nothing the devil wants more than to have disoriented about your destination, confused about your purpose for your life NOW, obsessed with the future, and/or feeling guilty about your PAST life or even yesterday!

One of the things that I often confront in dealing with people is their inability to define their PURPOSE because of guilt and shame. The devil will do every possible thing to tempt you into something he can later on blame you for. Have you found that out? He uses people to accuse you, to make you feel like to have no right to get up in the name of God, and fulfill your purpose. That attitude is always demonic.

Anything that distracts your pivotal relationship with God, and your purpose for this life, is demonic and RELIGIOUS!

Here is the call from Jesus to fulfill your purpose in the next DECADE. Matthew 5: 13-16-The Message

"Let me tell you why you are here. You're here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? You've lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage.

"Here's another way to put it: You're here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We're going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you don't think I'm going to hide you under a bucket, do you? I'm putting you on a light stand. Now that I've put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand—shine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, you'll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven."

Ask God to transform your life, (Galatians 5-Fruit of the Spirit-The Message), cleanse you by His GRACE, and then claim your PURPOSE for the next decade.

Being salt and a light for God, in this world calls for audacity, commitment, and spiritual strength from Him.

Let me assure you something: **if in the midst of the most chaotic circumstances, you can remember that you** have been called by God," you will regain your sense of significance and your will be re-energize! I know it without a doubt! That's what pulled me our of the biggest, most horrible mess of my life.

Let it sink for a minute: **You, yes, you... You have been called by God to live for Him, with Him, and in behalf of Him in this life!**

How you face your tests and tribulations will reveal your sense of significance. Do you remember, **"you have been called by God?"** This is an important question, because you never know when your life will end. You never know if you will have a chance to "succeed" at what you set your mind to accomplish. But you can always be certain you are fulfilling your call by God. We are here on this earth, to bring glory to God—to show how to love again, and again... nothing more, nothing less. The purpose of our lives is to learn how to love. To show others how to love. (Matthew 22: 37-40). The heart of significance is to be able to catch the fact that **God has called you to fulfill your purpose, this bringing glory to Him.**

The only reason why you are here on earth is to learn how to be loved and love again. **SIN** by Lucifer, Adam and Eve was a relational challenge to the very existential nature of God. You don't fight **SIN,** you let God love you; you learn to love again! **SIN is simply the absence of love.**


# Your Life Has Value

Regardless of your age at this moment, God has been watching you since the day you were born. God has been allowing things to happen or not to happen. There is no room for arrogance in God’s universe. Yes, you made choices, but your choices were enabled because God let it happen! When God chooses to override your freedom of choice, you are DONE, Friend! God is the supreme manager of the entire universe.

There is only one thing I hang on to: and that is the fact that every thing that happens to you as a follower of God, in this life, God promises to use to shape you for eternity! That’s it! I can hold on to this in the midst of darkness. I can hold on to this, when people tell me horrible stories of their past life. People share with me dark secrets of their past. Abuse suffered… They show me the scars on their walls of their hearts. Disillusionment. Shattered dreams. Hopes that will never crystallize in reality. Lives cut short by a tragic accident, cancer or drug overdose. Why? Why? You, see… I don’t know!


“Before I shaped you in the womb, I KNEW ALL ABOUT YOU. Before you saw the light of day, I had HOLY PLANS FOR YOU” Jeremiah 1:5 (The Message)


“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart." Jeremiah 29:11-13-NIV

No one, on the face of the planet, loves you more than God. No one longs to bless you more than God. Did you know that?

It begins with a PROMISE. “I have plans for you.” God always initiate the process of loving. That’s the difference between RELIGION and a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. Religion reminds you of what you need to do to reach up to God. A relationship with God reminds of what He has already done for you. You must respond to His love!

Then comes YOUR CHOICE. “You will seek me and find me.” He never forces us. We seek Him by choice. And He promises us we will find Him.

But, you see, nothing from God is granted to you, to simply enjoy a good life. Every gift from God has a purpose! He calls you to share His blessings with the world.

The closer you walk with God, the more you will feel His heartbeat, the more you will begin to see how EVERYTHING is connected even if at the moment it feels intolerable! The tapestry of your life is one that includes your choices, your rejections, your unexpected serendipitous events, other people’s decisions, and God’s intervention and supervision above all things! Nothing escapes God’s vigilant eye.

You may not be aware, just now, of the reasons why things happened to you, but the more you cling to God in your personal relationship with Him, the more you will see the connections. And here is the key, you will only understand and trust that God is in control of every detail of your life, as you surrender to Him… As you learn to walk with Him. He will open your eyes… He will give you supernatural wisdom and you will be amazed at God’s grace and magnificent attention to the details of your life!

“He knows us far better than we know ourselves, knows our pregnant condition, and KEEP US PRESENT BEFORE GOD. That’s why we can be SO SURE THAT EVERY DETAIL in our lives of love for God [Relationship with God] is WORKED into something GOOD." Romans 8:28-The Message

“You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good” (Gen. 50:20).

Do you believe that when you surrender to God, He can use your past, your hurts, your wounds, your enemies, your experiences for your own and others good?

Do you believe God is managing your for a special purpose? Nothing is an accident, when you give God the control of your life…

This is what I know. God is more than a rational, intellectual reality you can grab like a text book, to understand. He is a RELATIONAL God. You can only catch glimpses of Him in a personal relationship with Him. You catch glimpses of God when you read the Bible, when you pray, when He whispers in your mind. What your relationship with God can not satisfy, your mind will never comprehend! Are you with me, Friend? Followers of God in word, without a relationship with Him, are a contradiction in terms. That’s why I often say, it’s easier to become a religious Christian and repeat the lingo, than it is to walk with God, read the Bible, contemplate God, meditate, reflect, and pray for enlightenment! Without a relationship, you do not have depth to grasp the reality of God.

“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live]." —Ephesians 2:10

If you are a follower of God, NOTHING IS A MERE ACCIDENT! God is bigger than your circumstances. It may not be fair. It may not be understandable. It may not make sense. But, Friend, God will take whatever happens to you, and turn it around into a blessing! Romans 8:28

# God is Good

King David composed a song to declare the goodness of God. One of my favorites Psalms. Psalm 145:8-21 (The Message)

**"God is ALL mercy and grace—not quick to anger, is rich in love.**

**God is good to one and all; everything he does is suffused with grace.**

**Creation and creatures applaud you, God; your holy people bless you. They talk about the glories of your rule, they exclaim over your splendor, letting the world know of your power for good, the lavish splendor of your kingdom.**

**Your kingdom is a kingdom eternal; YOU NEVER GET VOTED OUT OF OFFICE.**

**God always does what he says, and is GRACIOUS in everything he does.**

**GOD GIVES A HAND TO THOSE DOWN ON THEIR LUCK, GIVES A FRESH START TO THOSE READY TO QUIT.**

**All eyes are on you, expectant; you give them their meals on time.**

**GENEROUS TO A FAULT, you lavish your favor on all creatures.**

**Everything God does is right—the trademark on all his works is love.**

**God's there, listening for all who pray, for all who pray and mean it.**

**He does what's best for those who fear him—hears them call out, and saves them.**

**GOD STICKS BY ALL WHO LOVE HIM, BUT IT'S ALL OVER FOR THOSE WHO DON'T.**

**My mouth is filled with God's praise. Let everything living bless him, bless his holy name from now to eternity!"**

The God King David described in this Psalm **IS MY GOD, Friend!** That's the God that melts my heart! That's the God that drives me, and moves me to do what I do! He has been good to me beyond my wildest dreams!

“God is good!” has become my mantra, when people question things, when people write about their most inner secrets. God is always good! I believe that religion misses the goodness of God, in attempting to make sure people get God’s holiness, justice and wrath. God’s holiness is rooted in His love. God’s justice is based on His love. God’s wrath is driven by a love that is beyond our comprehension. We don’t have a mind to understand the holy passion of God for humanity! The cross, the death of Jesus, what he endured only give us glimpses of a LOVE that beyond our rational grasp!

**"Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, NOT REALIZING THAT GOD'S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?"** Romans 2:4 (NIV)

Do you realize, Friend, that God's goodness, grace and compassion is intended to melt your heart? His goodness is intended to make you feel loved, cared for, so in turn you can love others? You are not just one more in the mass of people. You are God's special creation. There is no one else in the world like you! God is watching you day in and day out!

>If you **let God love you**, you will experience an outpouring of His presence that will drive you to be generous, give, love, care for others, tell them about God's gift of grace...

If God's love and goodness doesn't drive to love your spouse, your children, your friends, your co-workers, your employees, your boss, the people of your world, nothing else will! If the goodness and the extravagant love of God doesn't drive to give generously, nothing else will! God is good, Friend!

I believe God is good and He takes delight in doing good things for people. He does indeed hold our hand in times of trouble and helps us stand against the onslaught of life’s difficulties.

In the midst of whatever is going on in your life today, I invite you to pause and reflect on God. King David describes in powerful words, God’s character. We can verily grasp the depth of these words.

King David composed a song to declare the goodness of God. One of my favorites Psalms. Psalm 145:8-21 (The Message)

“God is ALL mercy and grace—not quick to anger, is rich in love.

God is good to one and all; everything he does is suffused with grace.

God’s there, listening for all who pray, for all who pray and mean it.

He does what’s best for those who fear him—hears them call out, and saves them.

GOD STICKS BY ALL WHO LOVE HIM, BUT IT’S ALL OVER FOR THOSE WHO DON’T.

My mouth is filled with God’s praise. Let everything living bless him, bless his holy name from now to eternity!"

The God King David described in this Psalm IS MY GOD, Friend! That’s the God that melts my heart! That’s the God that drives me, and moves me to do what I do! He has been good to me beyond my wildest dreams! I don’t know any other God! I am committed to preach, reach out, build “Life Center,” share the Good News with the people of Pasadena to the day I die, or Jesus comes back to take me home. I love God with passion!

“Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, NOT REALIZING THAT GOD’S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?" (Romans 2:4 (NIV))

Do you realize, Friend, that God’s goodness, grace and compassion is intended to melt your heart? His goodness is intended to make you feel loved, cared for, so in turn you can love others? You are not just one more in the mass of people. You are God’s special creation. There is no one else in the world like you! God is watching you day in and day out!

If you let God love you, you will experience an outpouring of His presence that will drive you to be generous, give, love, care for others, tell them about God’s gift of grace…

If God’s love and goodness doesn’t drive to love your spouse, your children, your friends, your co-workers, your employees, your boss, the people of your world, nothing else will! If the goodness and the extravagant love of God doesn’t drive to give generously, nothing else will! God is good, Friend!

If you let God love you, you will experience an outpouring of His presence that will drive you to be generous, give, love, care for others, tell them about God's gift of grace.

The Great Controversy between God and the devil has already been won! When Jesus died on the cross, on a Friday evening and said, "It is finished," He meant what He said: "It is done." The Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, became a symbol of the finished work of God in the Universe. REST for those who walk with God. Sunday, was the beginning of a new chapter. The resurrection of Jesus! He did no only rest from the work of SALVATION on behalf of humanity, but He sealed it with a new victory... **ETERNAL LIFE!**

God is the victor for ever! Satan has been defeated for ever! So, whose side are you on?

## Who is God?

**God is beyond our imagination.** I have always loved contrasts. I am fascinated by contrasts and opposites. It intrigues me.

* **God is the superlative of contrasts and extremes. If you define the "ends" of God, with "poles" like the south and the north pole, God's extremes would go so far, that would would never see both ends. Beyond your wildest imagination is God!**


Psalm 8 (The Message). There was no Hubble telescope when King David wrote this hymn. It make the Bible even greater! Almost 4.000 years ago, David was describing what we see today! Amazing, the greatness of God, Almighty!

**"God, brilliant Lord, yours is a household name. Nursing infants gurgle choruses about you; toddlers shout the songs that drown out enemy talk, and silence atheist babble."**

**"I look up at your MACRO-SKIES, dark and enormous,

your handmade sky-jewelry, moon and stars mounted in their settings. Then I look at my MICRO-SELF and wonder, Why do you bother with us? Why take a second look our way?"**

**"Yet we've so narrowly missed being gods, bright with Eden’s dawn light. You put us in charge of your handcrafted world, repeated to us your Genesis-charge, Made us lords of sheep and cattle, even animals out in the wild, Birds flying and fish swimming, whales singing in the ocean deeps."**

**"God, brilliant Lord, your name echoes around the world."**

* Do you wonder why Lucifer turned against God? He gave "created humans" more than what he ever got. I believe Lucifer found out about God's plan to create such an amazing world for these new creatures with the ability to pro-create themselves, enjoy life, pleasure, love, each other, and he went ballistic! Envy ate him alive! It was "us" that antagonized Lucifer against God. Envy. Greed. Pride. His broken religion and idolatry drove him crazy!

* God's universe is beyond what we understand. So vast. How many planets are inhabited beyond Hubble? How many natural scenes from "another world" are there to be discovered and explored? Yet, God chose planet earth to be the capital of His universe? He put everything on the line for you and me?

* And... **God is here with us? With you and me, 24/7?**

* The same power that created 100 billion galaxies, is the same power God has available to love you in our infirmities, in your temptations, at the moments when you fall, when you doubt.

He forgives your sins—every one.
He heals your diseases—every one.
He redeems you from hell—saves your life!
He crowns you with love and mercy—a paradise crown.
He wraps you in goodness—beauty eternal.
He renews your youth—you're always young in his presence.
God MAKES EVERYTHING COME OUT RIGHT;
HE PUTS VICTIMS BACK ON THEIR FEET.
He showed Moses how he went about his work,
opened up his plans to all Israel.
God is sheer mercy and grace;
NOT EASILY ANGERED, he's rich in love.
He doesn't endlessly nag and scold,
nor hold grudges forever.
He doesn't treat us as our sins deserve,
nor pay us back in full for our wrongs.
As high as heaven is over the earth,
so strong is his LOVE to those who fear him.
And as far as sunrise is from sunset,
he has separated us from our sins.
As parents feel for their children,
God feels for those who fear him.
He knows us inside and out,
keeps in mind that we're made of mud.
Men and women don't live very long;
like wildflowers they spring up and blossom,
But a storm snuffs them out just as quickly,
leaving nothing to show they were here.
God's LOVE, though, is ever and always,
eternally present to all who fear him,
Making everything right for them and their children
God has set his throne in heaven;
he rules over us all. He's the King!
- Psalm 103, Message

Would you trust God today? He is watching everything. He knows everything. He won’t drop you.

# God Cares

It is not too big, nor is it too small and insignificant for God. He cares! Kind David wrote, **"Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer. From the end of the earth I will cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I"** (Psalm 61:1–2).


God is exactly what God meant to be to humans: "Immanuel." (God with us) A God in the here and now. A relational God!

"Immanuel" (God with us) is not about victory and glory, first. "Immanuel" (God with us) is about PRESENCE first.

The best portrayal of God's presence among humans happens between the humble birth of God as a baby and Friday on the cross (God with us).

The vast distance between the human and the divine is brought together by the wholeness of a God who became incarnated in human flesh and innocently become subject to everything that human beings are subject to—including suffering and death. God reflects the archetype of the human experience: INNOCENT SUFFERING.

John 3: 16-17 are words said by Jesus echoing God’s heartbeat for you and me!

“For God so LOVED the world that he GAVE his one and only Son, that WHOEVER believes in him SHALL NOT PERISH but have eternal life. For GOD DID NOT SEND HIS SON INTO THE WORLD TO CONDEMN THE WORLD, BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD through him."

This passage contains the fundamental truth you need to understand and accept if anything else will make sense. God loves you, and He wants YOU to be in His family! That’s it! Once you catch a glimpse of His love the rest follows! Once you understand how passionate God feels about you, that love will drive you to do what is best for yourself! You will want to obey Him… Spend time with Him… Tell others about Him… Nothing will be too much! Love is the most powerful driving force in the universe!

Do you know God’s love has a purpose?

“Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that GOD’S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?" Romans 2:4 (NIV)

The word “repentance” in the English language does not reflect the true meaning of the word in the original Greek. “Repentance” has its root it the Old Latin which translated the Greek ("metanoia") as “paenitentia” which came to mean penance or acts of penance that had to be done if one hoped to obtain grace. By extension it became sorrow, contrition, a penitent attitude.

The original word in the Greek “metanoia” is a word loaded with dynamic action. It simply means to “change one’s mind and perception of whatever preceded the act of “metanoia” or ‘repentance” It means you were going in one direction and the sparkle of God’s Spirit enlightened you, and you suddenly saw you are wrong, and changed! You see how offensive your action, disposition and behavior is to God!

God’s kindness is intended to lead you to want to CHANGE!

Everything God does for you has that purpose! To lead you to that moment, or moments of “metanoia.” (Repentance) To lead you into a state of mind and heart that says, “Wow, how could I not change for such a LOVER!” Doesn’t that ring to you like the best motivation for change ever?

His love, His kindness, His compassion, His goodness is meant to create in you the desire to change into His likeness! His goodness is to make us generous and compassionate toward others the way He is towards you!

If the goodness of God does not melt your heart, and you choose not to change out of pride and selfishness, NOTHING else will do it. If love does not melt your heart, punishment will not do it either! It will make you bitter. If goodness and love do not drive you to love others, a hard life won’t do it either! I have watched people going down into the darkness of their own selfishness, drowning in toxicity, with negative feelings and emotions, demon possessed, bitter against the world… and I have always thought the same… “Wow… They chose not to give in to the goodness of God! They chose to reject love!” That’s why I understand the concept of hell a little bit! There is no hope for someone who rejects love! Only a miserable life! There will be no room in heaven for people who have rejected love. It would be the most miserable existence ever! “Hell” is God’s last resort of grace, for people who reject love. Did you know that?

God’s goodness at all levels, and in all its manifestations has ONE SINGLE PURPOSE, Friend…

TO LEAD YOU TO CHANGE, AND BECOME THE LOVER GOD CREATED YOU TO BE, BEFORE SIN GOT HOLD OF YOU! To take you back to His original purpose… Love will always be the law of His universe!

Do you feel unworthy?

Do you feel that no matter how much people tell you, "you are good," you still feel like you are not?

Do you struggle with being human? Has someone planted in your head the idea that the "people of God" don't commit more sin?

There are two reasons why people feel unworthy of God's love and His presence.

* Living a sinful life, apart from God, by choice. God is being rejected every day, every hour by choice!

* Confusion about God's forgiveness and how He declares you perfect! Religion has made a mess of this! There are many views and doubts regarding this subject. The Bible taken in all its entirety makes it clear. Bible verses, picked to serve one view or other, create the mess religion feeds on!

"Perfectionism" and "reward for goodness" are two strong strategies the devil uses to confuse followers of God! Remember what we said @ "Life Center"? All the temptations and strategies the devil uses against people come under two categories, **"SEDUCTION"** and **"SUFFERING."** "Perfectionism" and "reward for goodness" fall under seduction. Those two concepts are a delusion that causes enormous confusion when dealing with reality.

God promotes "wholeness." "Wholeness" is the opposite of "slices" like in a pie. Religion teaches "pie Christianity." In other words, God is a slice of your entire life. The best quote born in the soil of such mindset is "God helps those who help themselves." Many people believe this is a Bible verse! :-) Followers of God believe and promote "wholeness." It means, God pronounces His followers perfect, good, holy, 100% acceptable to be citizens of the Kingdom of God! Under God's eyes, you are 100% when you accept Him in your life. There is no "but" or "if" kind of presupposition! God's declaration of perfection is absolute, complete and permanent. Are you with me, Friend?

* Followers of God believe that **God helps those who can not help themselves.** The best candidates for the kingdom of God are people who are broken, hurting, dissatisfied, up against the wall, disillusioned, frustrated... people who have failed!

* Once you accept your complete inability to please God with your "human goodness" or make Him hate you with you "sinfulness," you surrender to God and He accepts you "wholly". He declares you perfect! Your act of surrendering, though, is the beginning of perfection at your level of consciousness! You are aware of it now! God is not at a desk, checking a list while you wait in line to be forgiven! :-)

* Your new awareness of God's forgiveness is not an act God performs when you surrender to Him. That's where religion confuses people with "before" and "after." Pray the "sinners' prayer" otherwise you are going to hell, say some Christians! **Once you surrender to God, God says, to you... "Did you know that during all those years of rejection, you were already forgiven?"** That's what is so overwhelming about God's grace! All your sins from the past were forgiven 2.000 years ago on the cross of Calvary! And even 6.000 years ago before planet earth got into this horrible mess called SIN! God was not caught by surprise! God was not caught unprepared for the devil's presence! He knew and made provision.

* Not only that, all of your future sins have already been forgiven to the day you die. Tomorrow's sins? Forgiven! Next week's sins? Forgiven! Next year's sins? Forgiven! Everything is forgiven! **Religious people get very uptight with my statement!** But you see, Friend, lovers don't play games! If a follower of God sins intentionally against God's will, because he has been declared "saved," he/she does not really understand the love of God! Authentic lovers don't play games with lovers! If a wife says to her husband, "I will never leave you, divorce you, even if you do the worst thing you could ever imagine doing to me! Even if you betray me, get totally irritating, boring, unloving... I will not leave you! The only way you can get rid of me, is by leaving me, and going to a place where I can never find you." That love, that devotion, that loyalty is not be played with lightly! God is like that, Friend! God does not lose by giving you total assurance of forgiveness and perfection. You do, if you play games with God! The same in any human transaction. The giver never loses! Simply gets better!

If you are perplexed in your spiritual walk, I want to share with you a magnificent message today. It comes from Romans 3:21-31 (The Message). Read it, think about and ask God to engrave these words in the depths of your brain! Repeat it... Make it yours, until it finally becomes a part of you! \[My comments\]

**"The God-setting-things-right that we read about has become Jesus-setting-things-right for us. And not only for us, but for everyone who believes in him. For there is no difference between us and them in this. Since we've compiled this long and sorry record as sinners (both us and them) and PROVED THAT WE ARE UTTERLY INCAPABLE \[Please notice the language, "utterly incapable." It means that will power, habits, strategies, predisposition, good DNA, background, motivational strategies taught by gurus, religion... NOTHING! We are "utterly incapable"...\] OF LIVING THE GLORIOUS LIVES GOD WILLS FOR US, GOD DID IT FOR US! Out of sheer generosity he put us in RIGHT STANDING with himself. A pure gift. He got us out of the mess we're in and restored us to where he always wanted us to be. And he did it by means of Jesus Christ."**

**"God sacrificed Jesus on the altar of the world to clear that world of sin. Having faith in him sets us in the clear. God decided on this course of action in full view of the public—to set the world in the clear with himself through the sacrifice of Jesus, finally taking care of the sins he had so patiently endured. This is not only clear, but it's now—this is current history! God sets things right. HE ALSO MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO LIVE IN HIS RIGHTNESS."** \[The same power that set us right, is also transforming us every day into His likeness!\]

**"So where does that leave our proud Jewish insider claims and counter-claims? Canceled? Yes, canceled. What we've learned is this: GOD DOES NOT RESPOND TO WHAT WE DO; WE RESPOND TO WHAT GOD DOES! \[Simply amazing!\] We've finally figured it out. Our lives get in step with GOD and ALL OTHERS BY LETTING HIM SET THE PACE, not by proudly or anxiously trying to run the parade."** \[Did you noticed? The presence of God in your life does not only set you right with Him, but with others also. Lying, falsehood, cheating, hypocrisy, using people for your own purposes... these are all manifestations that God is not running the show!\]

**"BUT BY SHIFTING OUR FOCUS FROM WHAT WE DO TO WHAT GOD DOES, don't we cancel out all our careful keeping of the rules and ways God commanded? Not at all. What happens, in fact, is that by putting that entire way of life in its proper place, we confirm it."**

Here is the one strategy that can totally revolutionize your spiritual life, today, Friend! I promise you... It will eliminate your perplexities, doubts about how good you are, if you are performing according to God's standards. **SHIFT YOUR FOCUS FROM WHAT YOU DO, FROM WHAT PEOPLE DO, TO WHAT GOD HAS DONE, IS DOING, AND WILL DO ALL THE WAY TO THE END! God is the God of all people, all around the world!**

# God's Heart for the World

Unbelief, rejection, lack of spiritual passion for a relationship with God, blindness for the needs of people, break God’s heart, because He knows the consequences. But when the door of the human heart is shut, He refuses to enter forcibly. He will only knock, wanting to gain admittance. He has given us the ability to choose. But when we choose the wrong thing, He knows the repercussions that will follow—in this life and the one to come. And His heart is broken.

Would you recognize God if He would be in your midst? Would you welcome God’s personal visit to you? What if God would visit you in the person of a homeless person? Would you see Him? What if God would come to your church? Would He be allowed to preach? What if God would invite you to make a commitment to Him beyond anything you have ever done? What if God would invite you to have a daily time of devotion with Him? Reading the Bible, praying? Would you have the time for God?

What breaks the heart of God is REJECTION in all its manifestations. Lack of passion for lost people breaks the heart of God. It means you don’t understand how much He loves! Lack of passion for the hungry, the poor, the sick breaks the heart of God! You are His hands and feet on earth!

Will you accept God in your life today? Will you follow Him? Will you invite someone to join the family of God? Will you pray for lost people? Do you care? It’s all part of God’s invitation to LOVE RECKLESSLY.

# The Gospel is Good News

What is the Gospel?? I don’t think most people really know.

If we will be faithful to the spirit of the gospel, we should always allow the Spirit of God TO BUILD A BRIDGE, BETWEEN THE HERE AND NOW, AND THE LOVE OF GOD THAT DOESN’T' WANT ANYONE TO PERISH! (2 Peter 3:9). The pulsating core of the Good News is that God reaches out to us, FIRST, (1 John 4:9) and then He finishes the work of perfection in our lives! (Philippians 1: 6). Your only role in this whole process is to make a choice: “Yes” or “No."

“Then you will know the TRUTH and the TRUTH will set you free!” And the truth is not a dogma, it’s not a theological statement, it is not a set of beliefs! The question is not WHAT but WHO is the truth. In the Bible TRUTH is always relational and the end result is always freedom!; not religious and legalistic slavery and fear! Jesus said, “I am the TRUTH” (John 14:6) God is the TRUTH. The only way to know the truth is by RELATING to Him.

# Who is Jesus Christ?

Jesus explained, “I am the Way, I am the Truth, and I am the Life. No one comes next to the Father except through union with me. To know me is to know my Father too. John 14:6 TPT

Even though Jesus Christ is equal to God, he never spoke of Himself while on earth, but always spoke what He heard from His Heavenly Father. He was never selfish, but always God-centered.

“And being found in appearance as a man, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross."--Philippians 2:8

A peek into an experience Jesus had tells a lot about His humble and obedient disposition. He was starving to death during His temptation in the wilderness. The devil tempted Him. He would not turn a rock into bread after the devil suggested that He should. He answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God’ " (Luke 4:4).

Jesus was always thinking of others. He was humble! ALL LOVE. So what does it say about Him when He uttered the words from the cross, “I thirst” (John 19:28)? This was the Creator of the universe saying, “I thirst.” Do you think Jesus could have solved His own problem? Do you think He could have spoken water into existence? Yes. Jesus could have had Niagara Falls appear before Him if He so desired. But instead He said, “I thirst.”

This reminds us that although Jesus Christ was fully God, He also was fully man. Never for a moment did He give up His Divinity, though He did not displayed it in His miraculous events at will. He shrouded His glory. He was still always God. But the miracles He performed He promised you and I could perform also. He showed us the way. He led the way for you and me. (John 14:12) That is why His death, His voluntary death, and His death alone, was sufficient to meet the righteous demands of the Father. Amazing!

Take a moment today to thank God for becoming “Emmanuel,” God with us. He came to us, that we may know His supreme love. That we may follow Him, like He followed His Heavenly Father, even though, He was God! That His love may compels us to obey God, as Jesus obeyed God, even though He was still God!

If you want to start a relationship with Jesus Christ, or have fallen away and want to rededicate your life to Christ. Simply come to Him humbly by faith, confessing your sin and need of a Savior. Each person must sort out what to say to Jesus for himself, but one might try praying something like this:

"Jesus, I'm so sorry that I have been going my own way and not Your way. But I thank You so much for loving me enough to come and die for my sins. And now I'm so happy that in resurrecting you are alive and well, and I want to know You. Please come into my life, change my heart and mind, and let me know you deeply. I recognize You as King, please teach me how to obey and love You."

**"And being found in appearance as a man, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross."**\--Philippians 2:8

More and more I wonder how would Jesus look and behave in our contemporary culture. You know why I wonder? Because the people of His time went crazy with His humble demeanor. Read the Gospels. They thought He was a fraud! He did not match the hero they had come to expect of their prophesied and idolized image of the Messiah! They liked His power manifested in miracles and healing, but they did not know what to do with his humbleness. Judah would have loved to see Jesus manifesting His power. He would have been Jesus' campaign manager! Peter would have loved nothing less. The entire nation of Israel would have felt that their destiny had finally been fulfilled! Imagine!

If you were Jesus (God), would you ever be tempted to do a miracle for yourself? I probably would. If I had been Jesus, instead of walking long distances, I would have just said, "I am now going to be there," and there I would be.

A peek into an experience Jesus had tells a lot about His humble and obedient disposition. He was starving to death during His temptation in the wilderness. The devil tempted Him. He would not turn a rock into bread after the devil suggested that He should. He answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God' " (Luke 4:4).

**Jesus was always thinking of others.** He was humble! **ALL LOVE.** So what does it say about Him when He uttered the words from the cross, "I thirst" (John 19:28)? This was the Creator of the universe saying, "I thirst." Do you think Jesus could have solved His own problem? Do you think He could have spoken water into existence? Yes. Jesus could have had Niagara Falls appear before Him if He so desired. But instead He said, "I thirst."

(John 14:12) That is why His death, His voluntary death, and His death alone, was sufficient to meet the righteous demands of the Father. Amazing!

Do you catch a glimpse of the humble Jesus? Would he feel comfortable in our mega-churches? Would He feel comfortable with religion? Would He attend our large institutional churches? Where would you find Him? Would He be allowed to preach from the pulpits that proclaim to be the authentic church of God on earth? Where would you find Jesus? With what kind of people would He chose to spend time with? Would you consider Him a lesser Jesus because He would offer to sleep in your couch at your apartment? Would you expect Him to own His own airplane, stay in resorts, expensive hotels? Think about humble Jesus for a minute!

> Take a moment today to **thank God for becoming "Emmanuel," God with us. He came to us, that we may know His supreme love. That we may follow Him, like He followed His Heavenly Father, even though, He was God! That His love may compels us to obey God, as Jesus obeyed God, even though He was still God!**


# Salvation is Free

Grace in the Bible is the undeserved gift of eternal life, (John 3: 16, 17-The Message) God grants to a human being who accepts his sinful condition, and accepts Jesus as His Redeemer.

Ephesians 2:7-10 (The Message) is one of the most liberating messages of the Bible. It dismantles RELIGION totally! I call it the "RELIGION DEMOLITION" message directly from the heart of God. (\[My notes\]

"Now God has \[YOU\] where he wants \[YOU\],

with all the time in this world and the next \[God has all the time in the world. There is NO anxiety! God's journey begins with REST! No hurry\]

to shower grace and kindness upon \[YOU\] in Christ Jesus.

**Saving is all his idea, and all his work.** \[No religion, theologian or denomination can claim this one. IT'S ALL GOD'S IDEA\]

**All we do is trust him enough to LET HIM DO IT.**

**It's God's gift from start to finish!** We don't play the major role. If we did, we'd probably go around bragging that we'd done the whole thing!

No, **we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving.** He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing."

Did you know that “Grace” (The Gift of God, salvation, eternal life) is harder to accept than to reject it? It sounds crazy, uh? Sin has impacted our psyche in such a way that we struggle to accept love and grace. We have such a low concept of ourselves that we constantly find it easier to give, produce, work for something, and get a reward for it, than it is to accept anything because we are LOVED. We don’t know what to do with undeserved love!

Religious people have made it to appear that the narrow gate is so because of demands God places on us, which are very tedious to fulfill. Like the BIG 10! Right? Have you heard that view in religious circles? It sounds like you have to jump on a behavioral treadmill, and try to be perfect, keep trying and trying… because otherwise you will miss heaven or paradise. All the religions of the world teach this view, except God Himself. All religions are rooted in a reward system based on good or bad behavior. Did you know that?

The narrow gate is so, because it requires you to leave all your human baggage at the door! Can you see the image? The door is narrow, you can not fit through it with your big luggage!

Jesus reduced the BIG 10 to 2, and the 2 to 1: LOVE. (Matthew 22: 37, 38-The Message) You can not love God, yourself, or people, unless you accept the love of God, first! You can not keep the BIG 10 unless you learn to love from God Himself! (1 John 4: 19-The Message) The human attempt to obey God is human baggage at the door!

By human baggage I imply all of your GOOD and BAD deeds. All your goodness, intentions, resolutions, and EFFORTS to be good! The narrow gate requires freedom from human baggage, that can only be found in God! Surrendering is the answer to the challenge of the “narrow gate,” not trying to obey God! When you surrender to God, He transforms your heart, your tendencies, and you find yourself obeying God, and responding to life like He would!

SINNERS, who accept God in their lives, (Read the parable of the prodigal son, Luke 15: 11-32) make it easier through the narrow door, than religious people with all their attempts to be good and better.

Amazing Grace! Have you experienced the GRACE of God in your life?

# The Invitation

The Bible says about the human nature in Romans 3: 10-12 (The Message)

**"There’s NOBODY living right, NOT EVEN ONE, NOBODY who knows the score, NOBODY ALERT FOR GOD. They've ALL taken the wrong turn; they've ALL wandered down blind alleys. NO ONE'S living right; I can’t find A SINGLE ONE. Their throats are gaping graves, their tongues slick as mudslides. Every word they speak is tinged with poison. They open their mouths and pollute the air. They race for the honor of sinner-of-the-year, litter the land with heartbreak and ruin. DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT LIVING WITH OTHERS. They never give God the time of day."**

Do you struggle with your marriage? The reason is because you are broken. We all are. Relationships are troubled an conflicted. **We don't know the first thing about living with others**, says God! You may be very religious, but lousy at relationships. We all are! We are control freaks by nature. We hurt people with our words, our tone of voice, our selfishness, our judgments. Our reactions are like knives on the throats of others.

The human condition is sick, fragmented and broken, even if we don't recognize it.

So, the final question, the bottom line, is not whether you need God or not, but whether **you acknowledge you need God or not!**

Have you been trying hard to be good? Are you exhausted? Tired of trying to do better? See yourself failing over and over again? Do see glimpses of your brokenness here and there?

Here is Jesus's invitation to you and me:

**"Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and lightly."** Matthew 11: 28-30 (The Message)

What's your bottom line? Are you open to God? If not, why not?

What is the **TRUTH** of any matter?

Truth is most often used to mean in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or to a standard or ideal.

The commonly understood **opposite** of truth is falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy and religion. Many human activities depend upon the concept, which is assumed rather than a subject of discussion, including science, law, and everyday life.

Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars and philosophers. Language and words are a means by which humans convey information to one another and the method used to determine what is a "truth" is termed a criterion of truth.

There are differing claims on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are truthbearers capable of being true or false; how to define and identify truth; the roles that revealed and acquired knowledge play; and whether truth is subjective or objective, relative or absolute.

Many religions consider perfect knowledge of all truth about all things (omniscience) to be an attribute of a divine or supernatural being.

**Jesus was amazingly powerful in his definition of TRUTH.** Out of context, it could perhaps be considered the most arrogant statement of all times. No one ever claimed this definition of truth.

Jesus was either God, or He was the greatest deceiver that ever walked on the face of the planet.

John 14: 6 - **"Jesus said, I am the truth!"**

Jesus proposition is simple when it comes to spiritual "truth." Spiritual or religious truth is not a set of dogmas, doctrines, theological statements, presuppositions, discoveries, but **ONLY** relational. No one has ever claimed this so poignantly. Of course there have been "masters," "sages," "wise men," through the ages that pointed to the fact that by "association" or "discipleship" we could learn their "truth" or a "bigger truth." But Jesus doesn't say any of it. He simple say, **"I, am the TRUTH!"** Jesus is God! In other words, **"Truth can only be found relationally as we get to know God!"**

Want **TRUTH?** Walk with God. Spend time reading your Bible. Spent time praying. Spend time meditating. Spend time sharing God with people. Every time you spend time **WITH** God, doing what He **DOES,** reaching people for the Kingdom, **LOVING,** feeding the poor, listening to people, affirming them, loving them, you are actually **KNOWING TRUTH!** Isn't that a fascinating paradigm?

Spend time with Jesus, reaching people for the Kingdom, following God's passion, and you will **know TRUTH!**

**TRUTH** is always relational when it comes to God. Doing your own religious things and trying to discover truth in the Bible is really a waste of time. You know who said that? Jesus!

**“You have your heads in your Bibles constantly because you think you’ll find eternal life there. But you miss the forest for the trees. These Scriptures are all about me! And here I am, standing right before you, and you aren't willing to receive from me the life you say you want."** John 5: 39-40 (The Message)

# Let God Love You


But as many as received Him (Jesus) to them, He gave the right to become God’s children,  to those who believe in Him (John 1:12). 

So then when we come to God by faith and acknowledge our sins (our disobedience, our going our own way instead of His way), He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins, and not only that but to cleanse us of all unrighteousness. He transforms our spirits into new creatures, and we immediately enter into His eternal life as we submit to His holy presence.

The knowledge that God offers His love to you every hour of every day may not be new to you; what may be new is that you have to receive Him who is love or His loving forgiveness will not become yours. Generally, humanity gives and receives human love. That is because most people have not received God’s love. We cannot give something we do not have. It is vital in all of our lives that we receive God’s love so that we can love Him back and love those around us with His love. The essence of salvation is receiving God’s forgiveness, which is part of His love. So we begin by receiving His love. If we are born again, we have already received His loving forgiveness. At any time, we can open the door and ask Him to come in, even right now, you can simply tell Him that you want to know Him personally and live with Him forever, that you want to love and obey Him, that you know that Jesus paid the penalty for your sin on the cross and now offers you His loving forgiveness. Then out of simple faith in what God has said, open the door and receive Him. Receive His love, His forgiveness and the fullness of His Holy Spirit.

In order to be saved, we must have genuine faith. Faith is complete trust in something we can’t see but are certain of it because we believe it is true. Faith is not feelings or positive thinking. Faith is a gift from God.

Now faith is the certainty of things hoped for, a proof of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)

And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6)

The word “grace” means something which is given freely...without cost or obligation. You cannot purchase eternal life with good works, right living. Remember, God will offer it only as a gift to you if you truly want it! When man attempts to gain eternal life through his own works, he is no longer accepting God’s offer of eternal life as a free gift, that is, by Grace.

**Wow is about having one's mind blown away by the fascinating reality of the unexpected... The small things...**

**God's grace is His infinite ability, driven by love, to SURVIVE my choices, my stupidity, my limitations, and suffer innocently as God, like I suffer innocently my sinful nature...** That was truly a "wow" moment!

If you will humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, in His good time, He will lift you up (1 Peter 5:6)

Know that humility is also necessary to receive God’s love, to be lifted up by our heavenly Father. We must put aside the love and concern we have for ourselves to make room for the love of another. God’s love is all around us all the time. If we make room, He will surely come in. You may ask, “How can I control this ego of mine and humble myself so that I can receive God’s love?” Our ego doesn’t want to be dependent on anyone; it wants others to be dependent on us, so that we appear to be someone special. But there is only One who is not dependent on anyone and that is God. It is said that a humble person does not stoop smaller than he is; he stands at his real height seeing the reality of how small he is compared to God. When he humbles himself, he does not have to put on an act anymore because he has the real thing. 

Humility causes us to begin to fit into God’s kingdom and into the purpose He has for our lives which is fellowship with Himself. In trusting humility, we can open the door of our hearts and receive God’s love through a real, personal, loving relationship (Revelation 3:20). Then, through the power of His love, we have the strength to overcome our old sinful nature and love Him back. Because He loves us first, we are able to do our part and complete an exchange of love.

"So here’s what I want you to do...: **Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering."** (as act of worship)

Live your ordinary life as a **Divine WOW** because you are keenly aware of God's presence in your collective consciousness and world around. In fact later on Paul makes a distinction between a dull, flat life lived according to the culture and the **"WOW"** experience God enables in your life from within. You simply respond to the amazing love and grace of God.

# Living a Life of Surrender

Our society, our culture, our politicians and religion, don’t really have the answers for the huge challenges we face as a nation, and as a global community.

Total transformation is what God does in your life when you surrender to Him. He changes your motives. He changes your drive. He changes your values. He makes you compassionate. He touches you so you can talk to other about Him. He makes you a witness of His glory and power so can reach other for the Kingdom of God.

“He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love."-- Colossians 1:13

Jesus introduces us in the New Testament to what I call an upside-down life style.

His strategies to live your best life ever on this earth, begin at a different point that what the world considers a good platform for success and happiness, and His strategies are not practical advice for successful living, but rather **prophetic declarations** pregnant with the promise of something way better than what the world offers. So the starting point, and the destination, of Jesus strategies, are both upside-down, counter culture modes of life.

The word Jesus uses through Matthew 5:3-12 is translated as "Blessed" which in the Greek is the word "_makarios_." In ancient Greek times, "_makarios_" referred to the "gods." The blessed ones were the "gods." They had achieved a state of happiness and contentment in life that was beyond all cares, labors, and even death. The blessed ones were beings who lived in some other world away from the cares and problems and worries of ordinary people. **To be blessed, you had to be a god.** This is very important to understand the radical teaching of Jesus, Friend. "_makarios_" took on a second meaning. It referred to the "dead". I know this may sound contradictory, but follow me for a minute. The blessed ones were humans, who, through death, **had reached the other world of the gods.** They were now beyond the cares and problems and worries of earthly life. To be "blessed" ("_makarios_.") you either had to be a god, or you must have died and gone to live with the gods or become a god yourself. That is the origin of the different saints days -- they are remembered on the dates of their deaths. That's when they reached their stated of "blessedness" or "sainthood." Finally, with the passing of time the Greek usage of the word "_makarios_" came to refer to the elite, the upper crust of society, the wealthy people. It referred to people whose riches and power put them above the normal cares and problems and worries of the lesser folk -- the peons, who constantly struggle and worry and labor in life. To be "blessed," you had to be very rich and powerful. Isn't what the culture defines as a successful life? Happiness? I hear stories every week from people who tell me, "I want to be happy." "I have the right to be happy." "I have worked hard all my life and now is the time to enjoy myself and be happy." In other words, "I want to be above the hassles of ordinary life, and I just want to be free to do whatever I want." The lure of that life style in our culture is huge! Why? Because we see celebrity and the cultural icons of society seemingly living that life of leisure and hedonistic pleasure. In Jesus thinking it not the elite who are blessed ("_makarios_"; the happy, successful, accomplished, above the care of this worlds because they have everything they need). It is not the rich and powerful who are blessed. It is not the high and mighty who are blessed. It is not the people living in huge mansions or expensive penthouses who are blessed. Rather, Jesus pronounces God's blessings (Happinesss, success, joy, "_makarios_") on the lowly, the poor, the hungry, the thirsty, the meek, those who mourn and grieve. Throughout the history of this word, it had always been the other people who were considered blessed: the rich, the filled up, the powerful.

**Jesus turns it all upside-down. The elite in God's kingdom, the blessed ones in God's kingdom, the happy ones, the ones overflowing with joy, the successful ones are those who are at the bottom of the heap of humanity.** Now, tell me something... Isn't this radical? Totally counter-culture?


Jesus called people who were at the edge of catastrophe, BLESSED! Did you know that? Imagine, if someone tells you, “I am dying of cancer…” And you say, “Well, you are blessed, because now, you will know something about the power and the peace of God, you have never known before!” It is hard to imagine that… Yet, that is exactly what Jesus said!

“You’re blessed when YOU’RE AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE. With less of you there is more of God and his rule."

“You’re blessed when YOU FEEL YOU’VE LOST WHAT IS MOST DEAR TO YOU. Only then can you be embraced by the One most dear to you."

“You’re blessed when you’re content with just who you are—no more, no less. That’s the moment you find yourselves proud owners of everything that can’t be bought."

“You’re blessed when you’ve worked up a good appetite for God. He’s food and drink in the best meal you’ll ever eat."

“You’re blessed when you care. At the moment of being ‘care-full,’ you find yourselves cared for."

“You’re blessed when you get your inside world—your mind and heart—put right. Then you can see God in the outside world."

“You’re blessed when you can show people how to cooperate instead of compete or fight. That’s when you discover who you really are, and your place in God’s family."

“You’re blessed when your commitment to God provokes persecution. The persecution drives you even deeper into God’s kingdom."

All these pronouncements from Jesus are describing extreme conditions in all aspects of life. Environmental, financial, emotional, relational, physical and spiritual conditions. God comes to the assistance and help of people who are at the END OF THEIR ROPE. That explains, by the way, the reason why Jesus' crowd, was mostly composed of common people, homeless, “sinners”, the sick, the mentally disturbed, people whom the culture looked down on!

What we consider human failure, God calls OPPORTUNITY.

What we call scars, God calls stars!

What we call stumbling blocks, God calls stepping stones.

What we call weakness, God calls strength!

What we call losing the battle, God calls a victory for His kingdom!

What we call impossibilities, He calls possibilities.

What we call sinners, He calls saints!

The apostle James reminds us the following: “Consider it a SHEER GIFT, friends, when TESTS and CHALLENGES come at you from all sides. You know that under pressure, your faith-life is forced into the open and shows its true colors. So don’t try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way” (James 1:2–4 The Message). Suffering and pain have a way to refine you, make you fit for the Kingdom of God, compassionate towards others, and draw you closer to the heart of God!

God is not for strong people! It takes surrendering to give up self, and walk by faith. It takes exactly the opposite of what the culture teaches us to walk with God. Followers of God join a counter-culture movement when they surrender to God. It takes vulnerability to learn to trust. It is easy to grow up, it is hard to “ungrow” and become “like a child” again, once habits, tendencies and behaviors have been established for years! (Matthew 18:3)

Have you ever felt like God is too demanding? Is total surrender too difficult? Throughout eternity, you will realize it was worth it to live for God on this earth! No sacrifice is too big! No effort to bring people to the Kingdom of God, will go unrewarded. God is watching you and me now.

Here is the paradox. While God is not for those who are humanly strong, it takes spiritual fortitude and strength of character, to surrender to God! It is a jump into the unknown!

Jesus replied, “And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for my sake, will receive a HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH IN RETURN and will inherit eternal life. But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then” Matthew 19: 29-30. Can you think of any investment that will give you a greater return? This is not a literal expression. It simply means that what God will give us in the future will hundred times more valuable than what we give up for Him now!

Long term, I believe you will live with peace, and a hope that nothing else, and no one else, will ever be able to give you. Every trial you face, will make you better, when you are following God. God is in charge of your life, and He takes all situations and transform them for your own good. When you follow God, everything happens for a purpose. Romans 8:28.

**Whatever you have given up, hasn't God made it up to you already?** You gave up a few friends. Hasn't He given you better friends in their place? Hasn't God taken you to "Life Center" where people care about you? You have given up so-called pleasures. But in retrospect, don't you realize that they weren't pleasures at all, but addictions—and destructive ones at that. You have seen how your life has changed, and God has already made it up to you. That's the first think I want you to realize, Friend. There are immediate results when you choose to follow God!

**And then the best is yet to come.**

I believe that followers of God receive immediate positive results when they choose to follow God. Their life style is conducive to health and well being.

Long term, I believe you will live with peace, and a hope that nothing else, and no one else, will ever be able to give you. Every trial you face, will make you better, when you are following God. God is in charge of your life, and He takes all situations and transform them for your own good. When you follow God, everything happens for a purpose. Romans 8:28.

Then you have the grand finale. Because when you die believing in God, it's but a split before you wake up and se Jesus come in the clouds of heaven. Is anything better than that, Friend? To rest in the assurance that we go to sleep on this earth, under God's care.

Then we all go to heaven. We will have rewards waiting for us there. Then after thousand years, heaven will come to Earth, and we will forever and ever live eternally on this earth renewed. Revelation 20. We will have the rule and reign of Christ on the Earth in the new kingdom, and we will be a part of that. Earth will become the capital of the universe. No one in the entire universe will be closer to God than humans. Jesus, is one of us, and we will be like Him in body. We will be ruling and reigning with Jesus then. And that statement of Jesus in response to Peter's question will be fulfilled then. Oh, Peter... Yes... But then, what about you and me, Friend? Don't you feel like Peter at times?

So whatever you have given up—or whatever you are giving up—will be more than made up to you, friend!

Throughout eternity, you will realize it was worth it to live for God on this earth! No sacrifice is too big! No effort to bring people to the Kingdom of God, will go unrewarded. God is watching you and me now.

God surprises us with HIS EXTRAVAGANT LOVE when we are working up a deal with Him! His deal is so much better!! If His extravagant love does not melt your heart into surrendering your pride, your perfectionism, your habits, your arrogance, your independent attitude, NOTHING ELSE WILL MATTER!

God has the best deal for you, friend! Only, when you SURRENDER to the extravagant love of God as a bond servant, you become truly free! That's the paradox of authentic Christianity, and the dark side of religion.

**True freedom is found in surrendering to Christ.**

**Way better than what you give up!**

# God Alone is Always Enough

One of the biggest fears that people face is the fear of lack. It's the fear that your needs won't be met - that you'll run out of resources and that God won't come through for you in time.

You may be in a situation of lack that you've never been in before, in desperate need of finances or other resources to simply meet your basic needs. Maybe you're facing an emotional or spiritual lack. The spirit of fear might be attacking you, telling you that God cannot meet your needs and that you won't make it.

**You need to know today that the enemy is a liar,** and God cares about your situation. He has a plan and He is working on your behalf to provide what you need at the right time. Even when it seems like nothing is coming your way, God always knows how to miraculously provide.

Whatever your needs may be - financial, physical, emotional, spiritual - you don't have to fear lack. God will provide for you, comfort you, nourish you and bring you back to a place of strength. Trust in His provision.

And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19 (NLT)

"..the ones who seek the Lord will not lack any good thing." (Psalm 24:10, MEV)

We are all facing increasing complexity in this world of ours. Yet, the message of Jesus, reminds us that a simple life, lived in the presence of God is the only thing that really matters.

“Don’t hoard TREASURE down here where it gets eaten by moths and corroded by rust or—worse!—stolen by burglars. Stockpile treasure in heaven, where it’s safe from moth and rust and burglars. It’s obvious, isn’t it? The place where your treasure is, is the place you will most want to be, and end up being. Matthew 6:19-34 (The Message)

“Your eyes are windows into your body. If you open your eyes wide in wonder and belief, your body fills up with light. If you live squinty-eyed in greed and distrust, your body is a dank cellar. If you pull the blinds on your windows, what a dark life you will have! [Jesus is referring here to what gets your attention! What you focus on! YOUR MIND IS THE EYE, THE WINDOW, OF YOUR HEART-The center of your passion and emotions!]

“You can’t worship two gods at once. Loving one god, you’ll end up hating the other. Adoration of one feeds contempt for the other. YOU CAN’T WORSHIP GOD AND MONEY BOTH [A better translation for money is MATERIALISM, that which keeps you busy pursuing money, power, and the tangible rewards of a busy life.]

“IF YOU DECIDE FOR GOD,…it follows that you don’t fuss about what’s on the table at mealtimes or whether the clothes in your closet are in fashion. There is far more to your life than the food you put in your stomach, more to your outer appearance than the clothes you hang on your body.

Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.

“Has anyone by fussing in front of the mirror ever gotten taller by so much as an inch? All this time and money wasted on fashion—do you think it makes that much difference? Instead of looking at the fashions, walk out into the fields and look at the wildflowers. They never primp or shop, but have you ever seen color and design quite like it? The ten best-dressed men and women in the country look shabby alongside them.

“If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers—most of which are never even seen—don’t you think he’ll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you?

What I’m trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with GETTING, so you can RESPOND TO GOD’S GIVING.

Don’t worry about missing out. You’ll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.

“Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don’t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. GOD WILL HELP YOU DEAL WITH WHATEVER HARD THINGS COME UP WHEN THE TIMES COMES.

The most **EMPOWERING** presence for every **POSITIVE CHOICE** you make is God! Read these promises. Every time you make a **POSITIVE CHOICE** God is next to you, ready to assist you!

**For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.** (2 Timothy 1:7, NLT)

**I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation…I can do all this through him who gives me strength.** (Philippians 4:12, 13- NIV).

**God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.** (Psalm 46:1, NIV)


# God is Simple

Religion teaches you that you have to do a bunch of things to reach perfection in the eyes of God. Nothing could ever be further from the truth of God! You are born forgiven, though imperfect. If you believe and walk on the state of perfection God has declared for you, you will die forgiven, though imperfect. You are perfect by God's **TOTAL,** complete forgiveness, though you will always remain imperfect as a human being! The opposite of what I am describing here is **PERFECTIONISM.** Perfectionism is a constant striving towards being better and better (morality) in order to gain the acceptance of God, and also earn reward or points towards a better looking mansion in heaven! Wow! Everything in our culture strive to teach you that you earn status by adopting rules and standards. Consequences is what corrects behavior, mostly. God, instead, begins with love, forgiveness and freedom!

Here is the reality, friend, unless you read the simple story of God from the Bible, unless you let God love you **FIRST,** and believe every single hour and day that you **ARE** perfect in the eyes of God, you will be confused by what religion will tell you! Religion will tell you that you are **PERFECT** if... if... if... God says, **"YOU ARE! GO INTO THE WORLD AND LIVE IT OUT!"**

If you choose to walk on the perfection God gave you, you **don't need to try to be better,** you simply need to surrender to the power of the God who is with you all the time (The Holy Spirit). The improvements and changes of your life you get by effort and sacrifice **DO NOT IMPRESS GOD** at all! They don't matter. What matters is your humble surrender to the transforming power of God. And that is the fundamental difference between **RELIGION** and a **RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.**

GRACE: Nothing is more explosive in the Bible than the concept grace. This is the bottom line that separates all RELIGIONS (Including the Christian religion) from those WHO have a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. RELIGION is the attempt to help God, to reach out to HIM. A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD starts with God, it follows that you surrender to His love, and God finishes the world of perfecting you. In GRACE, who believe in a 100%, undiluted, raw GRACE rooted RELATIONSHIP with God.

**"What actually took place is this: I TRIED keeping rules and working my head off to please God, and it didn't work. So I quit being a "law man" so that I could be God's man. Christ's life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I appear righteous before you or have your good opinion, and I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me. The life you see me living is not "mine," but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I am not going to go back on that."** Galatians 2:20-21 (The Message)

**"Is it not clear to you that to go back to that old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion would be an abandonment of everything personal and free in my relationship with God? I refuse to do that, to repudiate God's grace. If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily."** Powerful words of Jesus!

One of the marks of a follower of God is simplicity. Simplicity in our culture tends to have negative connotations. When we speak of someone who is "simple" we don't necessarily mean it as a virtue. But in the Bible **simplicity** is the basic quality of those who will live with God throughout eternity. Did you know that? Here are the words of Jesus...

**"For an answer Jesus called over a child, whom he stood in the middle of the room, and said, "I'm telling you, once and for all, that unless you return to square one and start over like children, you're not even going to get a look at the kingdom, let alone get in. Whoever becomes SIMPLE and ELEMENTAL again, like this child, will rank high in God's kingdom. What's more, when you receive the childlike on my account, it's the same as receiving me."** Matthew 18:2-5 - The Message

"God is simple... stop complicating your life with religion and personal anxiety..."

In Matthew 6 you will catch a glimpse of God's view that states that the "flow," enjoying the now, being free from worry and anxiety is the way to experience God's best for you. On the other side "religion, and trying to be and do" is the best way to lose sight of God's presence.

Matthew 6 introduces you into God's wholeness, God's simplicity and begs you to walk into it and let yourself be. Read it slowly and you will get the idea Jesus is trying to convey.

“Be especially careful when you are trying to be good so that you don’t make a performance out of it. It might be good theater, but the God who made you won’t be applauding." Matthew 6 (The Message)

“When you do something for someone else, don’t call attention to yourself. You’ve seen them in action, I’m sure—‘playactors’ I call them—treating prayer meeting and street corner alike as a stage, acting compassionate as long as someone is watching, playing to the crowds. They get applause, true, but that’s all they get. When you help someone out, don’t think about how it looks. Just do it—quietly and unobtrusively. THAT IS THE WAY YOUR GOD, WHO CONCEIVED YOU IN LOVE, WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES, HELPS YOU OUT."

**"Summing it all up, I'd say you'll do best by filling your minds and meditating on things true, noble, reputable, authentic, compelling, GRACIOUS—the BEST, not the worst; the BEAUTIFUL, not the ugly; things to PRAISE, not things to curse. Put into practice what you learned from me, what you heard and saw and realized. Do that, and God, who makes everything work together, will work you into his most excellent harmonies."** What you just read is in the Bible. God is into the beauty of simplicity. Philippians 4:8 (The Message)

Simplicity in its true meaning, and out of the frame of the four misconceptions I listed above, can be a powerful voice for God. Children are simple. The most passionate love is simple. Authentic emotions are simple, as opposed to neurotic and twisted manifestations of denial.


# True Wealth

We live in uncertain financial times. Finances tend to create anxiety and stress. The one who has, wants to make sure, that what he has will last or increase. If you listen carefully to what is NOT being said in the world of politics, at the end of the day, it is all about economics. If you have money, in most cases you have POWER, and power moves the human world in which we live. Money buys positions, fame, reputation, compromise, excuses and even cheap love.

1 Timothy 6: 6-10 in The Message describes it the best.

"**A devout life does bring wealth, but it's the RICH SIMPLICITY of being yourself before God.** Since we entered the world penniless and will leave it penniless, if we have bread on the table and shoes on our feet, that's enough.

But if it's only money these leaders are after, they'll self-destruct in no time. **Lust for money brings trouble and nothing but trouble.** Going down that path, some lose their footing in the faith completely and live to regret it bitterly ever after."

When was the last time you heard some of the "money" gurus, or prosperity management principles, describe so clearly what true wealth is?

Even in times of financial uncertainty, it’s always important to keep things in perspective.

**"Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.**

What I'm trying to do here is to **get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with GETTING, so you can respond to God's GIVING. People who** don't know God **and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions.** Don't worry about missing out. You'll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.

Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. **God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes."**

Ask God to show you today, how to live a simple life, enjoying what you have while LOVING people. **LOVE** is ultimately all we leave behind when our days on this earth come to an end.

### Contentment

**"I’ve LEARNED by now to be quite CONTENT whatever my circumstances. I’m just as happy with little as with much, with much as with little. I’ve found the recipe for being happy whether full or hungry, hands full or hands empty. Whatever I have, wherever I am, I can make it through anything in the One who makes me who I am."** Philippians 4: 11 (The Message)

For Paul to write that he was content in every situation is truly amazing. At the time of this writing, **he was in jail** in Rome. Charged with sedition, treason, and other serious crimes, he had appealed to the highest court: Caesar himself. Without other legal recourse and friends in high places, he had to wait for his case to be heard. It seems as if Paul had the right to be an impatient and unhappy person. Instead, he wrote to the Philippians to say that he had **LEARNED** to be content.

Contentment is not natural for any of us. The competitive spirit in us drives us to compare, to complain, to covet, and to seek vengeance. Few of us are in a predicament such as Paul’s, but we all face difficulties in which we can learn to trust God and be content.

The art of contentment is finally learned when we catch the fact that God is the fulfillment to all of our needs. It doesn't matter what it is. You can go to God and talk to him about what hurts you, bothers you, inconveniences you. He will hear you and fulfill the deepest needs of your heart. It's a choice. One time, many times, until you **LEARN** that God is all you need!

# God Forgives

Forgiveness is such a huge issue with humans. Forgiveness is at the heart of the God dilemma with the universe. The character of God has been tested on his ability to forgive and the how of forgiveness! It is profound subject.

God is definitely a professional forgiver! God forgives forever. There is no unpardonable offense with God. Did you know that, Friend? Nothing, absolutely nothing is so offensive to God, that He can not forgive. Even rejecting Jesus as a historical presence on this planet, God will forgive! What has been called by religion “the only thing God will not forgive” is not really factually accurate. When a person who rejects God, walks away from God so far, by personal choice, that another 1 billion years wouldn’t make a difference because such individual is set against God, God let’s go! It’s not any more about forgiveness. It is all about a painful, merciful, graceful act of respect by God, to let go of such person! Hell is not so much punishment, but final act of grace and love for the one who would never accept God’s love, such as Lucifer and the demons. Hell is a final moment of mercy for people who have chosen to live a life of misery. Humans were never created to live without God. Are you with me, Friend? God forgives!

Jesus Himself said, (Matthew 22: 31,32-The Message)

“There’s NOTHING or said that can’t be forgiven. But if you deliberately persist in your slanders against God’s Spirit, you are repudiating the very One who forgives. If you REJECT THE SON OF MAN out of some misunderstanding, the Holy Spirit can forgive you, BUT when you REJECT THE HOLY SPIRIT, you’re sawing off the branch on which you’re sitting, severing by your own perversity all connection with the One who forgives."

God’s forgiveness is so passionate, intense and complete, that HE FORGETS. Imagine! No human being is able to forget a deep emotional injury! (Jeremiah 31: 34-Hebrews 8:11)

Jesus spoke a lot about forgiveness:

He said if we do not forgive we are simply revealing the absence of God in our lives. There are not excuses, DNA factors, temperamental pre-disposition of the depth of the offense. Matthew 6:15, says that if we do not forgive, we don’t belong in the Kingdom of God. God’s kingdom is about love!

Forgiveness or an unforgiving spirit is like a huge tree with deep roots in the heart. Here are some of the reasons why forgiveness is so important!


True, authentic forgiveness says, you accept the human condition. The human condition is broken. All of us are messed up! Would you agree with me? Jesus said it bluntly when He was on the cross, talking about the people who betrayed Him, Judas, the CHURCH, those who pierced his hands and feet with nails! Luke 23: 34-The Message “Father, forgive them; THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING." If you can think of your offender and accept that they are human, at times possessed by evil forces, they don’t know what they are doing! If you accept this fact, YOU WILL AMAZINGLY BE ABLE TO FORGIVE!

True, authentic forgiveness declares your dependance on God to fulfill your human needs. When a human let’s you down and you forgive, you are simply declaring that God is the source of your fulfillment. You deprive yourself of God’s abundant forgiveness when you say, “I won’t forgive this person, I will avenge myself, I will divorce the jerk, I will hurt the offender to teach her a lesson…” When you do that, you are walking on your own, and God doesn’t owe you anything! God respects your rebelliousness. God’s kingdom is a kingdom of LOVE not one of revenge!

True, authentic forgiveness opens the gates for God to perform miracles! Did you know that, Friend? When you take the pressure off a human being, your offender, by the act of forgiving, you are tacitly telling God, “God, you take over!” Great story in Matthew 18:23-35-The Message

True, authentic forgiveness is healing to your own soul. I have had the sad past experience to specifically ask forgiveness from 3 people for sins I committed against them. They chose not to forgive me! One said “NO” in front of a whole congregation, the other two said “yes” but their hurtful and vengeful behavior after the facts told me clearly I had to pay for what I did. I believe that an unforgiving spirit sickens the emotions, causes havoc in the brain and the immune system, destroys relationships, intoxicates the mind, and causes sickness. James 5: 16-The Message

True, authentic forgiveness allows God to use the pain the offender inflicted on you to shape you according to His unique purpose for you. Last Saturday night I spoke about Joseph. God used the pain his brothers caused Him to shape him. God used the pain the King’s wife cause on him to shape him. The devil tried to destroy the “dreamer” in Joseph. God used the trials to take him to the top. I have memorized the words of Joseph, because that’s the way I feel about every one that has ever hurt me, and I pray that God will bless those I have hurt and have forgiven me with the heart. Genesis 50: 20-The Message Joseph replied, “Don’t be afraid. Do I act for God? Don’t you see, you planned EVIL against me BUT God used those SAME PLANS FOR MY GOOD, as you see all around you right now—life for many people. Easy now, you have nothing to fear; I’ll take care of you and your children.” He reassured them, speaking with them heart-to-heart. God developed an amazing heart of compassion in Joseph, during all those dark moments that tested His faith in God!

WHAT GOD DOES NOT HEAL, OR SUPPLY IN YOUR LIFE, NO ONE, NOTHING WILL SATISFY EVER. Only temporary relief, then reality again! Or what’s worst, guilt and darkness!


# The Power of Belief

When Jesus was crucified, it was an enormous shock to His followers. They secretly expected Him to establish His kingdom on earth when pushed against the wall! They saw how Jesus was mistreated. To the last moment, they waited for a divine manifestation of power to take care of Jesus, and prove to the world He was indeed the Messiah, the liberator of the Jewish nation. They figured out that if Jesus was able to heal the sick, provide food to crowds out of nothing, wine out of water, He could also perform a miracle in His behalf! But instead, He was beaten, spit on, ridiculed, and hung on a Roman cross. They heard with their own ears Jesus' words, “It is finished.” Then they watched Him die before their very eyes. They went back home on that Friday evening thinking it was OVER! It was good as it lasted.

The power of God is manifested upon those who BELIEVE. Doubt is deadly to your relationship with God. **Believing begins with gratefulness.** You will never believe God with all your heart if you are not grateful for what He is doing in your life, now. It’s your attitude, not your aptitude, that will give you altitude. Gratefulness is a transforming attitude. Why would you believe in God, if you feel negative about your life? If you don’t see anything to be grateful for? Believing is rooted in gratefulness. Perhaps, you need to ask God to change your eyes, your mind, to see how He is blessing you in the midst of adverse circumstances. Gratitude is a spiritual powerful habit. From gratitude you will move to joy, to worship, to adoration… and TO BELIEVING in the power and the love of God.

# How to Live Like Jesus

Start by knowing God's written word. There is so much extensive wisdom and knowledge about God, about human nature, and about God's dealings with mankind and vice-versa. Take some time to learn how to study the Bible, and then do it, study it.

By having God's spirit within you. Jesus started his ministry off by being baptized and the Holy Spirit came upon him. We human beings are all spiritual creatures; we have a body and we have a soul, but our spirit, our essence, is what will live on forever. Without God's spirit living within us, we are dead, we cannot live. God's spirit is what teaches us His will, He is what gives us joy in difficult times, and God's spirit is the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead! The very notion of being "saved", or being given eternal life, is identified by being reconciled with God, which ultimately means having God's spirit. By having God's spirit, we become a new creature, we are born again.

By understanding the intentions of Jesus through understanding His actions and His words. Jesus said and did many things, but he did none of it haphazardly, everything Jesus said or did was deliberate and profoundly intentional in the part it played or would play in the eternal scope of the whole universe. You cannot imitate Jesus if you have no idea what his objectives were. So study His words and His intentions carefully.

By doing everything that Jesus instructed his disciples to do. If you don't know what those things are, you're going to need to study. But we can always revert back again to the same fundamental principle, that Jesus said that all the law and prophets rest on two key commandments:

    1. Love God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. And,
    2. Love your neighbor as yourself.

But Jesus empowered his disciples through the Holy Spirit to lay hands on the sick and heal them, to cast out demons, and more. They were expected to do these things in love. It’s all always about love. Remember this, because it was reemphasized later in the New Testament especially by Paul, that nothing we do is meaningful or of any value without love.

If I have the gift of prophecy
and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, 
and if I have a faith that can move mountains, 
but do not have love, I am nothing.
(1 Corinthians 13:12)


# What is Love?

We follow those two greatest commandments—loving God and loving our neighbors—by imitating Jesus himself, and then teaching others to do the same. That is essentially what it means to be a disciple, or to be a Christian; it is to be someone who imitates Christ, or to be someone who imitates someone who imitates Christ (1 Corinthians 11:1).

The English language has a poor comprehension of the word ‘love’, because it has many different meanings. In Greek, there are actually six different words that all translate to the word “love” in English, such as agape versus phileo. The “love” expected of us is elaborated by the servant Paul.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. (1 Corinthians 13:4-8)

If one will do as Christ commanded, one will discover eternal life or love and peace, of joy unimaginable, a place where the knowledge of good and evil is replaced with divine love. A place where all of your ego "issues" vanish, a place that is very real. We call it heaven. It is real, it is a place, and it is hidden, a secret, unknowable unless it is revealed by the Creator. Search it out for yourself through faith and obedience to Christ. Find Christ and you have discovered the country! Don’t just believe in it, or have faith it exists, Jesus commanded us to find it, for it is in Him, and Him alone. The knowledge of good and evil does not work well, and the story of humanity proves it does not work at all. 

There is no fear in love [dread does not exist]. But perfect (complete, full-grown) love drives out fear, because fear involves [the expectation of divine] punishment, so the one who is afraid [of God’s judgment] is not perfected in love [has not grown into a sufficient understanding of God’s love] (1 John 4:18, Amp)

So while the disciples were trained to create disciples, and to teach, and to cast out demons, and to heal, the most important thing is that they were instructed to love, and to do all these things in that love.

By having regular, loving fellowship with the other disciples. We human beings here on Earth are the physical body of Jesus in his stead while He remains in Heaven, until he returns to rule and reign here on Earth. As the body of Christ, we are many body parts (1 Corinthians 12:12-31), and we must take our place in loving harmony with the other body parts.

By making more disciples. That is what Jesus did during his entire time of ministry on Earth. That is how Christianity—the fully realized structured kingdom of Jesus—came to be.

"If I speak with human eloquence and angelic ecstasy, BUT I DON'T LOVE, I'M NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF A RUSTY GATE. If I speak God's Word with power, revealing all his mysteries and making everything plain as day, and if I have faith that says to a mountain, "Jump," and it jumps, BUT I DON'T LOVE, I'M NOTHING. If I give everything I own to the poor and even go to the stake to be burned as a martyr, BUT I DON'T LOVE, I've gotten nowhere. So, no matter what I say, what I believe, and what I do, I'M BANKRUPT WITHOUT LOVE.

Humans idolize and worship what they admire... That doesn't mean that the subject of idolatry is LOVING! In fact, more often than not, the intoxicating mix of a need to be adored, and the admiration of people, reveal the absence of LOVE, thus the creaking of a rusty gate... Shhh... Can you hear it, Friend?

**Love is COMPASSION IN ACTION!** Only a relationship with God can teach you how to be **COMPASSIONATE IN ACTION.**

What force is predominant in my life? **LOVE** or **FEAR?** Ask yourself that question often. Love unites, bonds, brings together, feels empathy, creates community. Fear separates, pulls away, condemns, blames, creates differences, runs away, avoids comparisons, protects self from suffering, and unwelcome inconvenience. The habit of compassion, is the actual practice of relieving people of their suffering. Once you can empathize with another person, and understand his humanity and suffering, the next step is to want that person to be free from suffering. This is the heart of compassion — actually the definition of it.

I believe compassion to be a spiritual quality second to none. Compassion is a derivative of the deepest expression of love there is. Compassion is one of the few things we can practice that will bring immediate and long-term joy, fulfillment and peace. The kind that sticks!

God is the very model of love and compassion. This is the way the author of Exodus described the encounter between God and Moses in Mount Sinai:

Exodus 34:6-7 (God's Word Translation)

> **"Then he passed in front of Moses, calling out, “The Lord, the Lord, a COMPASSIONATE and MERCIFUL GOD, patient, always faithful and ready to forgive. He continues to show his love to thousands of generations, forgiving wrongdoing, disobedience, and sin."**

> **"Compassion is an emotion that is a sense of SHARED SUFFERING, most often combined with a desire to alleviate or REDUCE THE SUFFERING OF ANOTHER; to show special kindness to those who suffer. Compassion essentially arises through empathy, and is often characterized through ACTIONS, wherein a person acting with compassion will seek to aid those they feel compassionate for."**


**Love in the eyes of God when on this earth was the greatest commandment . . .** His prime directive—Let God love you, live loved, love God, love self, love neighbor, love stranger, alien, immigrants, LGTBQ, without racial or gender discrimination, the homeless, outsiders, outcast, and enemies, as he himself modeled it.

The **new commandment of love** (John 13:35 - The Message) meant that neither beliefs nor words, nor dogmas, neither taboos, systems, structures, organized religion, nor the labels that enshrined them mattered most.

The "new wine" (love and compassion) demands "new containers" (new system, new movement, a fresh relational theology, for **ALL** people). **ONE GOD for ALL people.**

**Love** decenters everything else; **love** shifts all religious obsessions into a minimalist basic ethos of community such as the early Apostolic church.

**Love** relativizes everything else; **love** takes priority over everything else—literally everything.

In fact **love** becomes more important than "right and wrong" according to religious or cultural constructs.

**At the end of time, at the Second Coming of God, the Biblical narrative says there will only be two groups of people.**

Those who understood **"LOVE IS ENOUGH"** and those who didn't (Matthew 25:31-46 - The Message)

God's minimalist relational theology will be made clear. The core of God ethos as a qualification for eternal life is not doctrines or belief systems but **LOVE and COMPASSION.**

Love is the only creative, constructive, and forward-leaning message of God for people from all religions and all walks of life.

I believe that the greatest challenges followers of God will face is how to remain loving and compassionate in the midst of a world where most people will lose their ability to love and be loved. (Matthew 24:12 - The Message)

> **To understand the love of God.** The only thing that makes you compassionate towards sinners and people who you feel **deserve punishment and discipline for what they have done** is the **LOVE OF GOD.**

Ephesians 3: 12-21-The Message

**"When we trust in him, we're free to say whatever needs to be said, bold to go wherever we need to go...**

**14-19 My response is to get down on my knees before the Father, this magnificent Father who parcels out all heaven and earth. I ask him to strengthen you by his Spirit—not a brute strength but a GLORIOUS INNER STRENGTH—that Christ will live in you as you open the door and invite him in. And I ask him that with both feet planted firmly on love, you'll be able to take in with all followers of Jesus the extravagant dimensions of Christ's love. Reach out and experience the breadth! Test its length! Plumb the depths! Rise to the heights! Live full lives, full in the fullness of God.**

**20-21God can do anything, you know—far more than you could ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams! He does it not by pushing us around but by working within us, his Spirit deeply and gently within us.**

There will be no peace in your heart until you experience the **love and the grace of God.** When someone has hurt you badly, betrayed you to the bone, the human side of you only considers consequences, punishment and pain. When you have been touched by the passionate love of God, you will long to see people turning to God.

# God Transforms Lives

**"The best is yet to come"**

Isaiah 61 gives us a powerful insight into God's transforming power.

The promises of this chapter were made to the Jews returned out of captivity, which extend to all those who, through grace, are delivered out of spiritual doom! So this message is for you and me, Friend.

**An unholy soul is like a city that is broken down, and has no walls, like a house in ruins; but by the power of GOD'S GRACE, it is fitted to be a habitation of God, a Kingdom of glory and beauty.** These are the words Jesus would use to proclaim the transforming power of His Kingdom on this earth!

**Isaiah 61**

The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners...

To proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion—

**TO BESTOW ON THEM** \[You and I, Friend \] **A CROWN OF BEAUTY INSTEAD OF ASHES, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.**

They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendor. They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations.

Instead of your shame you will receive a double portion, and instead of disgrace you will rejoice in your inheritance. And so you will inherit a double portion in your land, and everlasting joy will be yours.

“For I, the LORD, love justice; In my faithfulness I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them.

I delight greatly in the LORD; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign LORD will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.

**Total transformation** is what God does in your life when you surrender to Him. He changes your motives. He changes your drive. He changes your values. He makes you compassionate. He touches you so you can talk to other about Him. He makes you a witness of His glory and power so can reach other for the Kingdom of God.

When Jesus Christ truly comes into our lives, He takes up residence. And He doesn't just do a basic housecleaning; He does a thorough one. **There is real, total, deep transformation.** But when a house has only been swept, that is, when someone has made only moral changes, he or she is still vulnerable to the enemy. Did you know, you could be good without God, you can live a moral, ethically right life, and still end up in hell?

If the power and the presence of God has not been manifested in your life, and continues to be manifested every day, you are not walking with God.

This is why we must recognize the futility of simply turning over a new leaf or making a few new resolutions. We must realize the problem is deeper than our moral sins. We must get to the heart of the matter and have Jesus Christ take residence in our lives and change us from the inside out.

For the person who has made a mess of his or her life—a pile of ashes, God says, **"I will bring beauty."** For those who mourn because of the wrongs they have done and the sins they have committed, God says, **"I will bring joy out of it."** For those who have been rejected, hurt by others, God says, **"I will bring healing into your life, festive praise, instead of despair."**

Only God can do that; only He can take a tangled mess of a life, turn it around, and transform it in such a way that you would not even know that individual used to be a whole different person. God is not into the recycling business, he is into the total transformation of broken lives.

Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 5:17-20 (The Message) the following: **"Now we look inside, and what we see is that anyone united with \[Christ\] gets a FRESH START, is CREATED NEW. The OLD LIFE IS GONE; A NEW LIFE BURGEONS! Look at it! All this comes from the God who settled the relationship between us and him, and then called us to settle our relationships with each other. God put the world square with himself through \[Christ\], giving the world a fresh start by offering forgiveness of sins. GOD HAS GIVEN IS THE TASK OF TELLING EVERYONE WHAT HE IS DOING. We're Christ's representatives. God uses us to persuade men and women to drop their differences and enter into God's work of making things right between them. We're speaking for Christ himself now: BECOME FRIENDS WITH GOD; HE'S ALREADY A FRIEND WITH YOU."**

What a magnificent description of God's passion for you and me, Friend! God is your friend! God is longing to bless you, give you peace and rest!

If you come to Christ today and say, "Jesus, here I am. Forgive me of my sin, cleanse from my past life, mend the broken pieces of my life... heal my pain... I surrender to you, Jesus..." **He can transform and change you totally!.** God can take your mistakes and your sins, and the hurts other people have inflicted on you, turn them around, and even use them for His glory. When you commit your life to Christ, putting the broken, stained, twisted pieces into His hand, He will transform it into an incredible piece of Divine art!


# Jesus Wants You to be Free

Until you believe that God does everything RIGHT you won’t find peace in your heart! Every single event of your life, good or bad, is being managed by God if you are His follower. (Romans 8:28-The Message)

When you surrender to God, He takes your past, your entire life, and transforms it into something gorgeous. GOD ALWAYS DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT.

"...Your salvation requires you to turn back to me
and stop your silly efforts to save yourselves.
Your strength will come from settling down
in complete dependence on me..." (Isaiah 30:15-18 Message)

Galatians 5, (and the entire book of Galatians for that matter) is all about the freedom we can experience when we accept God, Jesus, His grace, and His power in our lives.  It doesn’t mean by any stretch of the imagination, we have arrived to a level of static perfection! It simply means that when God declares you FREE, you are free, indeed! FREE forever! You’ve got to believe God’s Word by faith. Trust that He means what He says! YOU ARE FREE WHEN YOU ACCEPT HIM IN YOUR LIFE. No one, nothing, will ever take that status away from you, except your own choice to live a miserable life of rejection of God, to the moment you breathe your last breath! The person who accepts [a rule keeping system] trades all the advantages of the free life in Christ for the obligations of the slave life of the law. When you attempt to live by your own religious plans and projects, you are cut off from Christ, YOU FALL OUT OF GRACE. Meanwhile we expectantly wait for a satisfying relationship with the Spirit. For in Christ, neither our MOST CONSCIENTIOUS RELIGION nor DISREGARD OF RELIGION amounts to ANYTHING. What matters is something far more interior: FAITH EXPRESSED IN LOVE. It is absolutely clear that GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO A FREE LIFE. Just make sure that you don’t use this freedom as an excuse to do whatever you want to do and destroy your freedom. Rather, use your freedom to serve one another in love; that’s how freedom grows. For EVERYTHING we know about God’s Word IS SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE SENTENCE: LOVE OTHERS AS YOU LOVE YOURSELF. That’s an act of true freedom. If you bite and ravage each other, watch out—in no time at all you will be annihilating each other, and where will your precious freedom be then? The magnificent FREEDOM of God granted to you by GRACE is grown, nurtured and affirmed by LOVE.  Live freely, animated and motivated by God’s Spirit. Then you won’t feed the compulsions of selfishness. For there is a root of sinful self-interest in us that is at odds with a free spirit, just as the free spirit is incompatible with selfishness. These two ways of life are antithetical, so that you cannot live at times one way and at times another way according to how you feel on any given day. Why don’t you choose to be led by the Spirit and so escape the erratic compulsions of a law-dominated existence? 

Have you ever experienced the freedom of God? Pray like this:

“God, I accept your freedom in the name of Jesus! I am free indeed, because you promised me that I could be free for the rest of my life. Teach me through your Spirit the implications of being a free person. Teach me how to embrace my humanity without shame… Teach me to accept the broken self in me the same you accept me! Give me eyes to see myself, like You see me, God! Grant me peace, now… Teach me how to forgive myself, when I make mistakes… I believe you took my SIN away forever when Jesus died on the cross of Calvary… Give me the strength to let go, and live as a FREE citizen of your Kingdom of Grace and Love. Remind me to look at people, like you see them! In the name of Jesus, AMEN”

# Rest Not Religion

Jesus Christ did not say anything about religion in the Bible! His focus was on the kingdom of God and your relationship with Him as His Bride! 

Being “Born Again” IS NOT a religion! It is an experience that God wants all who desire to know and serve Him to encounter.

What is the Church then? A Church is simply you, me, and others like us, who believe that Jesus is the son of God. To be a Christian is to be “of Christ “or to be a follower of Jesus. The word Christian is all inclusive. It needs no other word added to it for explanation or definition. Men have created denominations (churches) in order to separate and regulate those who profess to believe alike.

In reality, all faith is individual. No person believes exactly like another person. We all have a unifying point of faith and brotherhood: the Lord Jesus. He calls us to love and respect each other, but never to believe exactly alike. A person who has accepted Jesus as his or her personal Savior has done so just like all other Christians throughout history. Those who willingly devote their lives to Him find that they are doing more than just following His directions; they find themselves developing a loving relationship with Him. They call upon Him as a friend in times of need and times of joy. He is their constant companion. Now, if you have felt that God has abandoned you and that probably everyone else is enjoying this relationship but not you – don’t despair. God has promised never to leave you.

The real church is about Jesus Christ, loosing yourself not finding self; and also practical love for others. It’s simple - live in God’s love and share it with others. You can find God’s love in the secret place (the prayer closet).

Ephesians 2:7-10 (The Message) is one of the most liberating messages of the Bible. It dismantles RELIGION totally! I call it the “RELIGION DEMOLITION” message directly from the heart of God. “Now God has [YOU] where he wants [YOU], with all the time in this world and the next [God has all the time in the world. There is NO anxiety! God’s journey begins with REST! No hurry] to shower grace and kindness upon [YOU] in Christ Jesus." 

All we do is trust him enough to LET HIM DO IT.

It’s God’s gift from start to finish! We don’t play the major role. If we did, we’d probably go around bragging that we’d done the whole thing!

No, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving. He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing.”

Jesus is not a casual friend. He is not a once a week date kind of deal. He invites you to walk with Him, He doesn’t ask you where you are going so He can join you for a walk… He doesn’t tell you, “When you come back from work join me for a walk.” His invitation takes priority over everything you do. Think about it… Wouldn’t life be easier if we would get up every morning to walk with Jesus? Instead of going to work, you walk with Jesus. Instead of going grocery shopping, you walk with Jesus. Now follow me on this thought because here is the most fun part of walking with Jesus. He does not only invite you to walk with Him, but He leads the way into all those places where you think “you have to go.” Did you know that?

In another of His strategies for life He simply says, “Follow Me.” (Matthew 8:22) This is radical! 23 times Jesus said “Follow me.”

Have you ever considered the implications of following Jesus? When you are on the freeway and a car behind you bumps you, Jesus says, “Follow me!” What does that mean? It means Jesus was there before the incident happened! If you are truly following Jesus, every situation you walk into, every room you go to, every person you meet, Jesus is already there! Why would He otherwise say, “Follow me!” When you face an angry spouse, Jesus says, “Follow me.” That means He is already there dealing with the situation. When a loved ones dies, Jesus says, “Follow me”… In other words, it is safe for you to walk into this painful moment because I am here already… When you face a tough moment with your teenager, Jesus says, “Follow me.” In other words… I am here already! Walk with me is not just a casual spiritual experience with Jesus. It means CONFIDENCE because He is already walking ahead of us!]



# Stop Worrying

**Fear will paralyze you and keep you from the victory that God has planned for you. Fear is a spirit and the spirit of fear is not from God.**

**Peace is a show of confidence. Peace is the outward manifestation of an internal confidence and confidence is the manifestation of pure faith. Mature faith running at full power will destroy all of the plans and purposes of the enemy while delivering joy to the warrior of God. You can actually be swinging the sword of truth in what looks like the battle of your life with a smile on your face, peace in your heart, and victory on your lips.****

Because you know the Word and because the Word says, "Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world," you do not fear. Because you know God is on your side and because you believe Him, you stand in faith knowing that no weapon formed against you can ever prosper. You are victorious and you know it, and because you know it, you have peace.

Quit begging God to give you peace. He already has. Romans 5:1 says that as believers "having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Jesus is the King of peace and in Ephesians we are told that He Himself is our peace. (Ephesians 2:14) Not only that, but the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, God Himself lives inside of you. You are a three-part being. You are spirit, soul, and body. When you became a believer, the very Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, moved inside of your spirit. As a Christian, you are literally Spirit-possessed.

Your spirit is you, my spirit is me, and the Spirit of God is God. Because you are indwelt with the Spirit of God, you have the peace of God inside of you and regardless of what is on the outside, you have the fruit of the Spirit on the inside. As a Christian, He who is in you (The Holy Spirit) is greater than what is outside of you.

The peace of God should be flowing out of you into the world instead of the stress and pressures of the world getting into you. You have at your disposal the greatest power in the universe. Nothing can overpower the love of God and according to 1 John 4:7-8, God is love. Perfect love casts out fear.

Worry and stress are byproducts of fear. Rest and peace are byproducts of faith. To eradicate the fear, all we must do is walk in perfect love and be led by the Spirit. Then the peace of God will flow from us and minister to a world that is living in darkness.

Jesus said you are the light of the world. You have a responsibility to let the light shine from you into the darkness. Your testimony of peace will encourage and minister to others and you will discover through walking in the peace and rest of God that you will bring glory to God. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven." (Matthew 5:16)

Walking in faith will make you a warrior. Walking in fear will make you a worrier. Warriors overcome the enemy and enjoy peace and rest even during times of battle. Worriers live in a world of tension and stress, continually in fear at what might happen. What world are you living in?

# Get Close to God


The most important reason to get close to God is the fact that you were created BY God and FOR God. There is a hole in your heart that nothing else can fill. You were created to be a star in the skies of God’s universe! You were created to shine, not walk in this world holding a flash light! You were created to find greatness, not limits!

Do you know how good it feels to know, deep down in your heart, that you have been declared perfect by the GRACE of God since the time of eternity? You can not produce the kind of “goodness” that God wants to see in you, friend! He longs to do it, in you, His way!


You were created to dream BIG! **You were created for MEANING, not just morals. You were born for a PURPOSE, not just for a passing life on this earth! You were created to live in ETERNITY! Nothing, nothing, will fill the hole of your soul, except the immensity of God's presence! Nothing else suffices!**

King David in one of his psalms says, 

```
You're all I want in heaven!
You're all I want on earth!
When my skin sags and my bones get brittle,
God is rock-firm and faithful.
Look! Those who left you are falling apart!
But I'm in the very presence of God—
oh, how refreshing it is!
I've made Lord God my home.
God, I'm telling the world what you do!
```
&ndash; Psalm 73:25-28-The Message

When you are close to God, you get to know what **LIFE** is! God is your protection, your source of renewal, and energy.

Some people think being close to God is just for **RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.** Nothing could be farther from the truth! In fact, the opposite is the truth! God longs to befriend simple people! Regardless of your career, your social position in life, the baggage you carry from your past, you can get close to God. Getting close to God does not depend on some special gifting from God; getting close to God depends on your choice. God longs to be close to you! This is how easy it is to get close to God...

> James 4:8, The Message, says, **"Say a quiet yes to God and he'll be there in no time."** Did you catch that? This verse is both a command and a promise.


God is your fortress in difficult times. **God will never let you down.** Spend time with Him. Surrender every challenge you face to Him. One, by one... In the morning... Ask God to guide you **TODAY...** Just today... God is your best insurance policy in the world! As we wait for the Second Coming of Jesus, and our worlds spirals down, there is HOPE! God is YOUR hope!

Would you consider getting close to God today, Friend? There is no shame with God! There is no guilt with Him! He never accuses! He only **LOVES.** God infuses the pain and the suffering of this life with a sense of meaning! He turns scars into stars for His glory!

# Why is There Evil?

God commands two thirds of all the cosmic angelic forces, while the devil only commands one third. God has already defeated the devil since the times of eternity with a plan than was greater than Lucifer's rebellion against God. It's actually hilarious! The mess we call **SIN** was contained before it started! God never lost control of the universe. The **Great Controversy** is a cosmic display of characters. God principle to run the universe is **LOVE.** The devil's **counter-life-LOVE** movement (Fear-SIN) is already defeated and "contained."

God's plan to deal with this "temper-tantrum" was put into effect when God created Adam and Eve, during the Great Controversy for the 4.000 years prior to the coming of Jesus, and it was sealed on the cross of Calvary ("It is finished"- ) as a cosmic testimony to the universe, that the devil was actually defeated forever! And after Jesus' resurrection and ascension to heaven, the great controversy goes on, on a crescendo all the way to the Second Coming of Jesus, followed by the thousands years "vacation" we will take in Heaven, and the triumphal return to a renewed planet earth, capital of the Universe, and the total and absolute vanishing of demonic powers forever and ever!

>The greatest, most iconic image of the Great Controversy is the fact that we know the end before it happens. Yeah, there is some intrigue and anxiety going on in the minds of some, on how all this "time of the end prophecies" will play out, but the details are not important, and they are not for us to know. What is important to know is the signs of the times, and the end is secured since the times of eternity. Ephesians 1

God is not the cause of anything that is bad. It would totally contradict the nature of His character. **But God manages evil. And He is stronger and more powerful that the one who caused evil to happen in this world.**

“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, **“BUT THIS HAPPENED SO THAT THE WORKS OF GOD MIGHT BE DISPLAYED IN HIM."** (John 9:2-3)

Nothing happens in this world outside of God's control and His perfect management. God is bigger and greater than the evil forces that cause disasters, disease and chaos on this planet. God has never lost control of anything! Ever! Nothing is an accident in God's universe! The illusion that if you plan your perfect life you will be able to enjoy it, is a fallacy.... It is an illusion! Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. I have known people who have been the best managers of money you have ever met. They calculated everything. They were careful with their investments. They saved money. They made phenomenal moves at the right time and accumulated wealth! They put money aside for rainy days. They did all the right things. And then suddenly they got hit by cancer and they didn't get to enjoy any of it. True story! Others suffered empty, loveless lives in spite of their "perfect" lives. They feel empty, lonely and suffer of existential meaninglessness. So, money became empty! God may be allowing you to face a painful experience in your life now, for a PURPOSE! You may be the equivalent of the "blind" man with a different condition. And while people around you are questioning if you did something wrong to deserve such curse, or you are questioning yourself, or people are telling you that if you would have done things differently you would not be where you are at... While all the questioning is going on... God is saying... **"YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THIS TRIAL, THIS DARK SPOT... I WANT TO DISPLAY MY GREATNESS IN YOUR LIFE."** Imagine that!

There is nothing more humbling than to realize that your perfectly organized life does not make you happy. You can laugh a lot.... Entertain yourself a lot... Please yourself a lot... God created you with a hole in your heart for His **PURPOSE.** Nothing else will fill it out! Curse only turns into blessing when God takes over, like in the case of the blind man in Jesus' miracle Blessings turn into curse when you fail to bless the world by giving away what blesses you! What distinguishes you as a follower of God from those who are not, is your blessed life turned upside down to reach people for the kingdom of God. Hell will be intensely populated by good people, religious people, who lived the good life now to please themselves, and somehow forgot to find God's purpose for their lives.

**"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."** Romans 12: 21

Most of us experience evil on a smaller, more personal scale. But for all EVIL attacks, small and huge, the apostle Paul outlined the proper response in Romans 12: 14-21-The Message.

He said we are:

**1) to ABHOR evil** (Rom. 12:9),

**2) not to REPAY it with more EVIL** (v.17),

**3) and not to be overcome by** it (v.21).

The true victim of EVIL is goodness... Think about it! The goodness that God designed as part of creation for everyone to enjoy (Gen. 1:4-31) is attacked, shaken up, and terrorized by EVIL.

That's why it is so surprising that Paul concludes his magnificent expose on GOOD and EVIL by saying that at the end of it all, EVIL becomes a casualty at the hand of its CONQUEROR, which is GOODNESS! (Rom. 12:21). Don't miss this principle when dealing with your personal anger on any matter!

Evil gets all the headlines, but **GOD'S GOODNESS IS STRONGER,** and He wants you to use it on His behalf to overcome His and YOUR enemy. This principle gets me going! Why is it so hard to practice it? Why do people keep insisting on destroying those who hurt them? Why do people are so driven to seek vengeance and revenge? **It doesn't work, the Bible says!!!**

If you are facing the effects of someone’s EVIL actions I will share with you what healed me when I faced it in my own life. These Scriptures were incredibly helpful: Prov. 20:22; Matt. 5:38-48; 1 Thess. 5:15; 1 Peter 3:8-17. I recommend you read them in The Message to capture the full impact of God's word and its meaning.

Do not just be quick to point out EVIL. Anyone can do that! Find a strategy to deal with it! Use God's strategy!

It takes no effort to seek vengeance against a spouse in a marriage. It takes no effort to seek to destroy someone's reputation. It takes no effort to pay EVIL with EVIL. All you need is enough toxicity and EVIL in yourself, to drive you to destroy those who did EVIL to you! You can seek revenge in words, statements, accusations, gossip, innuendos, actions and constant obsession with the negativity that hurts you!

To abhor EVIL, not to repay EVIL with more EVIL, and not to be overcome by EVIL requires **God's supernatural power.**

Then, to overcome EVIL with GOOD, which is the higher level of spiritual consciousness, is impossible for humans to do, unless their hearts and brains are transformed by the cleansing grace of God.

Darkness is not REAL. It's just the absence of LIGHT. Light

overcomes darkness very quickly once you bring a light in... GONE!!!

EVIL is defeated already. Did you know that? Why use a DEFEATED strategy? Why? Every person who pays EVIL with EVIL, in words or actions, is ignorant of God's character. You can talk about saving lost people or religious truth, until you are blue on the face, but in the end, it is inconsistent with the spirit of God, if your political views drive you to say and act EVIL for EVIL! Every act of vengeance executed by people, simply shows demonic forces in action. Every person who seeks revenge for a hurt suffered is simply giving in to forces that were defeated by God since the times of eternity! Taking things into your own hands is a denial of God's existence! That's why Paul said: overcome EVIL, which was defeated at last on the cross of Calvary when Jesus said, "It is finished," with GOODNESS!

Think about it... The devil is walking around, tempting people, giving them the toys of life to distract them from God, destroying marriages... encouraging people to pay EVIL with EVIL , which brings instant gratification and fulfillment... well KNOWING that at the end of it all, HELL is his destination. The devil is a suicidal killer! It doesn't matter if he attracts you with good stuff, such as prosperity, good behavior, angels of light, money, security, morals, religion, sex, success or drugs... in the end his goal is the same for all... DESTRUCTION AND HELL. He wants to die surrounded by an adoring dying crowd!

Let the light of God, His love and His goodness be the marks of your response to EVIL inflicted against you!



# Know Your True Enemy

**IS THE DEVIL REAL?**

I have met many people who tell me they don't believe in the devil, or a Satan! They believe that whatever is going to happen, is going to happen, and we must endure and do our best! There is no cosmic controversy going on, according to them.

Here is what the Bible teaches are the demonic forces.

* **The devil can shows up as an angel of light** 2 Corinthians 11: 14 (NIV)

**"Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light."** There nothing further from the truth than the representations of the devil as a monster with horns, and a horrific look! If he would actually look and act like that, we would run away from him. The devil can show up as an angel of light to deceive. Seduction and deception are his strategies. The better an offer looks, the happier you are with your life, the better He likes it! If the devil offers you money, prestige, power, sensuality, comfort and you buy into as "the good life" he not only leaves you alone, but makes sure you ignore God's calls of attention, and even helps you prosper. He will make sure you can go to a church or seminar where you can learn the strategies for a successful life... As long as you don't surrender totally to God, he will leave you alone and enjoying your "good life." I spoke last night @ "Life Center" regarding the seducing, blinding power, of the demonic forces. If he can deceive you and seduce you to believe error, in a church or a religion, he is the happiest! What better way to distract from the true God, than by inviting you to worship a false god!

* **The devil is the source of all lies and deception. He blocks your understanding of the true character of God and His truth for your life.** John 8: 44-47 (The Message) Jesus words...

**"Why can't you understand one word I say? HERE'S WHY: YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT. YOU'RE FROM YOUR FATHER, THE DEVIL, AND ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS TO PLEASE HIM. He was a killer from the very start. He couldn't stand the truth because there wasn't a shred of truth in him. When the Liar speaks, he makes it up out of his lying nature and fills the world with lies. I arrive on the scene, tell you the plain truth, and you refuse to have a thing to do with me. Can any one of you convict me of a single misleading word, a single sinful act? But if I'm telling the truth, why don't you believe me? Anyone on God's side listens to God's words. This is why you're not listening—because you're not on God's side."**

Demonic forces take over in your mind and emotions if you allow it, keeping you in confusion, conflict, darkness... You say you don't get it? You say, you don't understand? You say, why so much talk about surrender? You don't see the pride in your heart? Jesus had the answer! It is tough truth!

* **Your relational struggles, your marriage conflict, family conflict, spousal cheating, conflicts with your boss at work, authority figures, bullying, betrayal, wounds inflicted by gossip and defaming comments, judgments and prejudice... it all comes from the same source, the devil! God discourages you from fighting with human beings!** Ephesians 6:12

**"For our struggle is NOT against flesh and blood, \[Human beings, people\] but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the SPIRITUAL FORCES OF EVIL in the heavenly realms."**

* **The devil is the source of ALL human pain. He started the whole mess in the universe by rebelling against God. He seduced Adam and Eve, introduced SIN in this world by lying, and from then on, SIN has been transmitted through our DNA. All you have to do to be a sinner is to be born. There is no hope for humans, except by the Grace of God! Every single ounce of pain and suffering in this world is from the devil. I shared with you last night @ "Life Center" how God manages the suffering and the chaos of this world.** John 10:10 (NIV) Jesus said this,

**The thief \[The intruder, your enemy the devil\] comes ONLY to steal, and kill, and destroy.**

Do you understand the words of Jesus,Friend? There is nothing good about the devil. It is all bad! His only purpose is to seduce you and destroy you! He knows He is sentenced to die forever, and is on a mission to take as many people down with him as possible! You cannot make a truce with the devil. He is and will always be, 24 hours a day, “your enemy the devil” (1 Peter 5:8)

* **The devil is set on destroying those who follow Jesus now! He will leave you alone if you are not following Jesus with your heart and reaching people for the Kingdom of God. The moment you set your mind in being obedient to Him, follow Him, and reach people for God, He will attack you!** Revelation 12: 17 (NIV)

**Then the dragon \[The devil\] was enraged at the woman \[The church of Jesus Christ on earth. Those who follow the Bible and God, not just in religion and word, but in passion and commitment to His cause in this world\] and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—\[Her offspring is God's people today. Those who follow God with their hearts, minds and will, all over the world\] those who 1) keep God’s commands and 2) hold fast their testimony about Jesus.**

If you are a passionate follower of Jesus, and you are involved in reaching people for the Kingdom of God, the devil has it against you! The stronger you get in God, the more the devil will attack you!

* **Followers of God don't need to be afraid of the devil. God is way bigger, stronger and powerful that the demonic forces. The devil and his demons are a defeated foe! They are destined to die. God has the power to protect from all demonic forces all the time.** Psalm 121:7, 8 (The Message)

**"\[God\] will keep you from all harm—**

**he will watch over your life;**

**\[God\] will watch over your coming and going**

**both NOW and FOREVERMORE."**

And whatever God allows in your life, He can also transform for His honor and glory. He has the power to turn your **SCARS** into **STARS** Romans 8:28 (NIV) **"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him."**

* **Here is your path to victory, Friend!** 1 Peter 5: 8-10 (NIV)

**"Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a ROARING LION looking for someone to devour. RESIST HIM, STANDING FIRM IN THE FAITH, \[Resist Him in the power of Jesus\]... And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, WILL HIMSELF RESTORE YOU AND MAKE YOU STRONG, FIRM AND STEADFAST."**

The Devil is like a suicidal mass killer. **The devil wants to divide to win!**

He knows he is condemned to die forever! He knows his battle against the Kingdom of God is LOST! He is terminally defeated! Forever! But he wants to take down as many people as possible with him. The two strategies he uses now are: “SEDUCTION” and “SUFFERING.”

The devil uses religion and false spirituality to keep you away from understanding the TRUE character of God! Churches are filled with people who feel guilty and have not experienced the refreshing, cleansing GRACE, the unbelievable forgiving passion, of God. The devil is the master of LUKEWARM religious people!

The devil wants you to fail in your personal life and relationships. The devil wants to destroy your marriage, your kids and create problems in your family.

The devil wants you to become negative and depressed about your circumstances. He doesn’t want you to read Romans 8: 31-39 (Today’s message).

The devil fills your mind with images of materialism, pleasure, comfort, worldly success, and seductive love, so when you get those things you “feel good,” and when you don’t, you slowly begin to feel like “crap.” Like you have no value! Like, “Why do others have it so good and I don’t!” The devil loves to plants those doubts in your head.

The devil seduces you to sin, like an angel of light… he shows you something and makes it attractive, you give in… you enjoy it for a moment, then SUFFERING follows… He hits you with embarrassment, shame, guilt, negativity, poor self-esteem… All that is demonic in nature! The Bible calls the devil THE ACCUSER OF GOD’S PEOPLE.

YOU NEED GOD to protect you from the evil attacks of your enemy.

For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. (Ephesians 6:12)

This is the one thing the devil wants you to forget and ignore. Once you have stared the devil straight in the eye, on the face of **SEDUCTION** or **SUFFERING** you will never be the same again. The first step into spiritual victory is to understand the nature of the **TRUE ENEMY,** the real cause of the human conflict. The Bible is clear. It is not people we must look at as our **REAL** enemies. It is the **DEVIL** who drives people and self to do what they do!

**Seduction** comes in the form of comfort, materialism, predictability, tangibility, idolatry (what you can touch, feel, smell, see and depend on-Political and social systems), false-empty pleasure, painless pleasure, the syndrome of the "greener grass" (delusion-illusions), competitiveness, efficiency, religion (creeds, beliefs, theological certainty, behavioral modification, morality), reward (Rich Young Ruler-Luke 18: 18-23), and a cause and result system; in other words, no room for the "Jobs," and "The prodigal Sons" of the world!

**Suffering** comes in the form of troubles, **RELATIONAL BREAKDOWN,** betrayal, vengeance, vicious attacks from "human enemies," accusations, judgment, **PERSECUTION** for the sake of God (people making fun of you, your popularity suffering because you stand for God-Even religion "persecutes" authentic followers of God), financial, physical, emotional and spiritual suffering.

If you are faced with any of the issues mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21 (The Message) you are definitely dealing with demonic forces! "The Message" translates the original language with power! \[My comments\]

"It is obvious what kind of life develops out of trying to get **your own way all the time \[SELFISHNESS-SELF ABSORBED\]: repetitive, LOVELESS, cheap sex; a stinking accumulation of mental and emotional garbage; frenzied and joyless grabs for happiness; trinket gods; magic-show RELIGION; paranoid LONELINESS; cutthroat competition; all-consuming-yet-never-satisfied wants; a brutal temper; an IMPOTENCE TO LOVE OR BE LOVED; divided homes and divided lives; small-minded and lopsided pursuits; the vicious habit of depersonalizing everyone into a rival; uncontrolled and uncontrollable addictions; ugly parodies of community. I could go on."**

People are imperfect. People make mistakes. That's human. We need to learn to forgive and love. (Mark 11:25; Luke 6:37-The Message)

**Demonic driven behavior**, however, must be acknowledged for what it is! If you don't discern it as such, most likely your life will be intoxicated by negative feelings projected on to people or self as the cause of your misery!

Here is my last point. To forgive people driven by demons is our duty as followers of God. (Mark 11:25; Luke 6:37-The Message).

Yet, spiritual discernment regarding the **root of the behavior** is very liberating. In fact, it creates a deeper understanding of how important it is to surrender our struggles to God. Jesus said on the cross, "Forgive them, for they **DO NOT KNOW** what they do! (Luke 23:34) Demonic driven people **DO NOT KNOW** what they do! **That's the basic truth regarding demonic possession.** They are blinded by demonic forces. Do not get into an argument, or attempt to reason with a demonic possessed individual! As in the case of Jesus' encounters with demons mentioned in the Gospels, a person may be possessed by demons multiple times; on and off; on and off during a whole life that has not been totally surrendered to God. Demonic driven behavior requires **GOD'S INTERVENTION.** Drugs, alcohol, religion, obsessions, illusions, and negative thoughts, are venues the Devil uses to posses a person.

The entire backdrop to the original story of sin and how humanity needed a savior is a preemption of a higher authority in the spiritual realm that is dark, evil, and damaging to the heart and psyche of humans. Between the Creator who is God and humanity who was born in God’s image there are many unseen entities created by God as angelic hosts. These, too, had the option of free will and the capacity to rebel against God. Those that did so, the angelic beings that rebelled and remain in rebellion against God, are called “fallen angels”, “demonic spirits”, or “demons”. The highest power among the fallen angels is Lucifer, or Satan. He was one of the greatest angelic beings in heaven, but in thinking himself higher than he ought, he rebelled and was cast out of Heaven.  Unlike humanity and the rest of physical life on Earth, God imposed no veil over the eyes of angelic beings—they have direct visibility to see God’s self-expression and the rest of the spiritual realm—but at the same time God gave them no plan of salvation. Instead, He gave rebellious angels limited freedom for a limited time to rule over the world, so that they may put humanity to the test. 
(Job 1:6-12).

It was a demonic angelic being, or Lucifer himself, that deceived humans from the beginning, as they ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The Bible uses the metaphorical reference to “the serpent” in describing Satan.

Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’” “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil. (Genesis 3:1-5)

So the world we live in consists of physical beings that are seen with physical eyes and also spiritual beings that are unseen, and all of the spiritual beings serve God in one way or another, directly or indirectly. The angelic beings that remain true to God’s throne thrive in God’s presence, and serve Him in different ways, including by protecting, guiding, or comforting human beings. The angelic beings that are in rebellion are out only for themselves and their hierarchical order, and human beings make ideal hosts and outlets for their rebellion. They aim to steal the attention of people away from God’s plan and cause humans to deviate or to also rebel. They are constantly scouring the Earth looking for vulnerable, weak people to ensnare with lies, deception, physical injury and sickness, and destructive habits and behaviors. In many cases they possess human beings. In fact, weak humans make ideal hosts for demonic beings, in part because humans are so engaged with the created world, but also because demonic entities love exacerbating the rebellion of creation against the Creator.

But angelic beings are not equal to God, they are not above God, they are sons of God. This is to be taken quite literally; angels do not multiply, they have no mothers who bear them through pregnancy, they are or were created on a whim through the creative power of God’s own self-expression. Jesus, who is the self-expression and personality of God come in the flesh, cast out many demons from people while he walked on Earth in the flesh. Indeed, he instructed his disciples that he had given his disciples power over demonic forces.

And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. (Luke 9:1) Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you. (Luke 10:19)

Some might argue that these words were apportioned for a time, specifically for the one or few outings they had, that month. Actually, the disciples were in training. One does not train for throwaway knowledge. These disciples were learning how to thrive under the jurisdiction and authority of the throne of God, because God was launching a new covenant with mankind. Ultimately, all power over all demonic forces must obey the throne of Jesus.

And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me”  (Matthew 28:18)

If nothing else, we can at least glean from this that Jesus can deliver us from anything, because He has authority over everything, and nothing is better than or greater than or more powerful than Himself. Therefore, if we intimately know Jesus and we have a complete and total dependence upon Him and our eyes are fixated upon Him, we should never be vulnerable to suffering successful attacks from demonic entities. Our responsibility in all of this, therefore, as Jesus’ own, is to pay attention to the spiritual realm and to spiritual forces, but to never allow our eyes to fall away from Jesus, and to call upon the authority of Jesus in the presence of evil.

The throne of Jesus can have immediate impact upon and relief from all manifestations of demonic activity, including perverted thinking, malice, hatred, extreme fear, destructive thrill-seeking, or harmful addictions.

And that about wraps it up. God is strong, and he wants you strong. So take everything the Master has set out for you, well-made weapons of the best materials. And put them to use so you will be able to stand up to everything the Devil throws your way. This is no afternoon athletic contest that we’ll walk away from and forget about in a couple of hours. This is for keeps, a life-or-death fight to the finish against the Devil and all his angels.

 Keep a cool head. Stay alert. The Devil is poised to pounce, and would like nothing better than to catch you napping. Keep your guard up. You’re not the only ones plunged into these hard times. It’s the same with Christians all over the world. So keep a firm grip on the faith. The suffering won’t last forever. It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ—eternal and glorious plans they are!—will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, he does.


# The Cross

**"IT IS FINISHED!" (John 19:30)**

These are the most important words in the Bible. When a follower of God understands the real meaning of those words the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus become an epiphany of glory and praise!

The cross was the goal of Jesus from the time He was born in Bethlehem by a miracle of God. His birth was so there would be His death. "Immanuel," which means "God with us," (Matthew 1: 23) was made possible for you and me. And here is the bottom line of the incredible, beyond words, passionate love of God for you and me: Jesus, God in human form, was born to die, so that you and I might live. And when He had accomplished the purpose He had come to fulfill, He summed it up in these 3 words: "It is finished!"

In the original Greek, it was a common word. Joseph probably used it after He finished a project that He and Jesus might have been working on together in the carpentry shop. Joseph might have turned to Jesus and said, "It is finished. Now let's go have lunch." It is finished. Mission accomplished. It is done.

**SO WHAT WAS FINISHED ON THE CROSS?**

1) **THE SUFFERING OF JESUS.** Finished and completed were the horrendous sufferings of Christ. Never again would He experience pain at the hand of wicked men. Never again would He have to bear the sins of the world. Never again would He, even for a moment, be forsaken of God. That was completed. That was taken care of.

2) **THE POWER OF THE DEVIL.** Also finished was Satan's stronghold on humanity. Jesus came to deal a decisive blow against the devil and his demons at the cross of Calvary. Hebrews 2:14 says, "Only by dying could he break the power of the devil, who had the power of death." This means that you no longer have to be under the power of sin. Because of Jesus' accomplishment at the cross, finished was the stronghold of Satan on humanity. **Satan and his demons were defeated for ever!** The devil has no control over your life, ever, unless you allow it. God has you covered!

3) **THE POWER OF SIN OVER YOU.** And lastly, **finished was our salvation. It is completed. It is done. All of our sins were transferred to Jesus when He hung on the cross. His perfect life was transferred to our account.**

There are two standards of goodness while we are in this world. One is the standard of religion, culture and society, which is primarily based on observable behavior. The other is God's standard that is based on the state of your heart. If your heart is God's even though people may point their fingers at your faults and shortcomings, God says, "He/she is covered by me! He/she is my child!" The devil has no control over you when you surrender to God. The growth and the changes you experience in your life are the result of God's presence in your life not some religious or psychological gimmicks of improved behavior.

Two days followed that incredible Friday evening after Jesus said, "It is finished"

THE SABBATH! The Sabbath was not just a day. It had been a whole symbol since the first week of creation. The Sabbath was as much an act of creation as what God created in the 6 days prior to creating the Sabbath! The Sabbath was actually created to celebrate the creation of the other 6 days.

That day had not been changed since the beginning of Creation. The Sabbath was created by God at the beginning, to commemorate His CREATION, and when Jesus died, Sabbath was the day of rest from the work of RE-CREATION! Jesus did not die on Friday by coincidence. The entire weekend was planned by God since the times of eternity with a purpose! The symbol of the Sabbath as a day of REST can not be underestimated. Sabbath, the 7th day of the week, means you and I can rest from the concerns of our eternal destiny. There is nothing more glorious and fantastic than that! When you chose to follow God, every Sabbath reminds you that God is your Creator and Re-Creator... and it also reminds you that you can have a **PEACE** that no human strategy or earthly good can give you.

Then came the first day of the week as it was called then!

As the Sabbath was a seal that the work of God was finished on behalf of the human race, the resurrection morning was a window into the power of God to keep His word. He promised salvation... He promised eternal life... He promised power to overcome the obstacles of this life, and He proved it by bringing Jesus back to life! Jesus went back to heaven with a human body like yours and mine to remind the entire universe that God's character was in harmony with the spirit of His creation on this planet.

Let me share a personal thought with you. There is no greater contradiction than the religious notion that God is waiting for you to become a good person! When someone says, "I am a good person, why do I need God?" he/she is simply devaluing the only "goodness" that matters in the eyes of God. When someone says, "I am OK, but I am trying to be better to make it to heaven" it must sound like an insult to the ears of a God that gave it ALL so you could be certain of your destiny. "God's goodness" is way greater than any self-generated human goodness. Good people, without God, do not understand the true nature of sin. Get this, friend... "SIN" is not the opposite of "GOOD." That's what religion and morality has made you believe! "SIN" is being **good or bad,** apart from God! It is as simple as that! Human goodness means nothing in the eyes of God!

The message of Jesus on the cross, "IT IS FINISHED" means that nothing can be done to improve the perfect work of God done for humanity. People will not go to heaven or hell on the basis of their goodness, but by accepting God in their lives as the only source of PERFECTION.

God has shown His power to transform death into life... Scars into stars... He has given clear evidence that He is powerful to overcome Satan and the demons... God, the Creator of the Universe is on your side, and He is victorious forever and ever! When you surrender your life to God, He looks at you and all He sees is a "PERFECT" person walking in a sinful world for a while.

There is no better **GOOD NEWS** anywhere else!

Jesus said that if we are to truly be His disciple, we are to “take up our cross daily and follow Him” (Luke 9:23).

But what does that mean?

To understand that, we need to understand the meaning of the cross in that time and culture. The cross has lost most of its original meaning today. It is shrouded in religiousness and mystery. It has become many things, from a religious icon to a fashion element.

When we see the cross today, it is a symbol of faith—particularly the Christian faith. But understand this, Friend. When Jesus said the words of Luke 9:23, He had not yet died on the cross. So, Jesus knew by cultural contextual reference, that the cross was a symbol of death. In fact, it was the symbol of a very cruel death. The Romans reserved it for the worst criminals. It was a form of torture and humiliation, ultimately leading to a long and painful death. Jesus knew that was coming to Him. And chose to speak to His disciples about the mark of His true followers. “Take up your cross and follow me!"

Why would Jesus use the cross to illustrate what it meant to follow Him?

Jesus intentionally used a gruesome symbol to get the people’s attention. He did this to say that following Him was not “child’s play.” It is not a game and IT IS NOT EASY. In fact, it will cost you to follow Him as a disciple. But, on the other hand, it will cost you more not to follow Him. There is a cost involved in being a disciple of Jesus!

What does it mean to “bear the cross” today?

Often, we hear people say that they have a “cross” to bear. They will say, “My cross is my parents!” Their parents would probably say, “Our cross is our children!” They identify whatever problem or obstacle they have as their “cross to bear.” But that is not what the cross means.

The cross symbolizes one thing: dying to self.

It really is a paradox: by “dying to self,” or “losing yourself,” you “find yourself.” Through death, you find real life. Matthew 10:39

What does it mean to “die to self”?

I realize that the whole concept of “dying to self” is so counter-intuitive to what our culture stands for. “Die to self” when you can leave your spouse and move on to a better temporary condition? “Die to self” when you are being taught that the person with the most toys wins? Not a popular statement by any stretch of the imagination. It is not the problem, or the challenge you face that becomes the cross you bear. It’s your reaction to the challenge. Do you get up and keep fighting in our power? Or do you die to self and surrender to God? That is the paradox of the cross! Allow me to give you a few practical examples of how this would work in day-to-day living.

To bear the cross means forgiving, instead of harboring that grudge or giving in to the possibility to get even! Has someone hurt you badly? Do you dream with revenge? Forgiving means dying to self. That’s the cross Jesus invites you to carry!

It means resisting that temptation to do what everybody else does. Standing alone in the midst of a crowd that is walking in one direction, when God says to you, “No. I want you to go this way!” That kind of obedience requires dying to self.

It means putting down the remote control and picking up your Bible. Or it means to stop watching the movie, the show, that fills your mind with unreal scenes of sensuality, and reading your Bible instead. Unless you die to self, you won’t be willing to do that! The Bible is nor emotional enough for your senses!

It means praying when you would rather be talking to a friend, watching TV, doing something else. Setting time for God in the secret chamber of your mind requires dying to self. There is always something more “fun” to do than praying! The 30 minute drive to work… you immediately turn the radio on… You need noise to survive boredom! Unless you die to self, it won’t occur to you that those 30 minutes you could be talking to God.

It means “swallowing your pride” and telling someone about Jesus. I am convinced that followers of God can not witness unless they die to self. I have watched Christians for years… They are ashamed to talk to people about God? Why? Their self is alive! It’s scary!

It means doing what God wants you to do, instead of what you want to do. This is a tough one. Because the moments when God speaks to us, can be split seconds, and if you did not hear God, it’s gone! Your brain is wired to do what you want to do. Did you know that, Friend?

To die to self requires a rewiring of your old brain, by the power and the presence of God in your life.

Now let me ask you, Friend “Are you dying to yourself and taking up the cross?” Is your religion huge in emotions, and short in authentic faith? Is your walk with God based on your moods and an emotional response or based on principles? Is your walk with God superficial, or do you get into the Word, and pray like your life depends on it?

Carrying the cross and dying to self is not an option for followers of Christ. It is a commandment. It is a duty. You don’t wait to feel good about it before you actually obey. You obey first, then you will experience joy and overflowing life!

This is the crux of the problem for many followers of God. They want to carry the cross, when they find a better spouse, or when they have more money, or when they feel like their life is on the right track. All to the contrary. The call to obedience is to take up your cross, whatever it might be, and die to self.

“The Warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought." E.G.White, Steps to Christ, p. 27

Paul summed it up well when he wrote: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me” (Galatians 2:20).

Jesus paradoxical statements can sound pretty unappealing. Let me get practical here.

You imagine yourself living in this miserable, sacrificial, unhappy condition, letting go of self and ending in the Mojave dessert hoping you can find yourself. But the fact of the matter is that nothing could be further from the truth. Note that Jesus says, “For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it!” Think of it as “God’s trade-in plan.”

I can not tell you how many times i have heard a man or a woman telling me that they are divorcing or separating because they need to “find themselves.” Excuse me? (By the way, I can’t stand that expression. 99% of the time it is an excuse for not choosing to love, or choosing to hide an affair) One makes that statement usually before doing something really selfish, like walking out on a marriage. They might say, “You are no longer meeting my needs. I am unhappy, so I am going to leave you because I need to find myself!” Amazing!

Could anything be more cliché, and wrong?

In essence, Jesus says, “You want to find yourself? Then lose yourself."

Do you want to find life, purpose, and personal happiness? Then say, “Lord, here is my life, I surrender my plans, my aspirations, my dreams, as well as my weaknesses, shortcomings, and sins. I believe that Your plans are better than mine in the long run." Surrendering to God is the way to let go of your life, and allowing God to give you a life blessed by Him.

But what does it mean to “take up our cross and follow Him?” This is explained in Luke 13:33: “Whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple." Literally, this means: “You must surrender your claim to everything and say goodbye to being in control.”

That does not mean that to live as a disciple of Jesus one has to take a vow of poverty and give every possession away. Jesus meant that we are to surrender our claim to our possessions. In other words, we are not to be possessed by possessions.

It’s fine to have clothes, a car, a house, and a career. It’s fine to have friends, hobbies, and interests. But the true disciple should not be obsessed with these things. The only obsession a disciple should have is for Jesus Christ. He must be the most important pursuit in our lives. He must be more important than our career or our personal happiness.

The fact is we will find the personal happiness we want not by seeking it, but by seeking Him.

Would you choose to do that today, Friend?

It could be letting go of anger… desire for vengeance… resentment… control over the affairs of your life… welcome interruptions with an open attitude… God may have something in store for you that you have no way to see right now…

“For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it” (Luke 9:23–24).

It may be letting of your expectations for a the marriage of your dreams. It may be letting go of your dreams to retire early and for some reason or other you find yourself not being able to retire. It may be someone betrayed you in a business transaction. Whatever the “cross” is… carry it in the name of Jesus, and God will bless you beyond your wildest imagination.
This is the crux of the problem for many followers of God. They want to carry the cross, when they find a better spouse, or when they have more money, or when they feel like their life is on the right track. All to the contrary. The call to obedience is to take up your cross, whatever it might be, and die to self.

**"The Warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought."** E.G.White, Steps to Christ, p. 27

Paul summed it up well when he wrote: "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me" (Galatians 2:20).


# Purpose of Suffering

**"Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world."** - C.S. Lewis

1 Corinthians 13:12 (The Message) **"We don't yet see things clearly. We're squinting in a fog, peering through a mist. But it won't be long before the weather clears and the sun shines bright! We'll see it all then, see it all as clearly as God sees us, knowing him directly just as he knows us!"**

It is true that God takes a life that is empty, or full of irrelevant stuff, aimless, and headed toward hell, turns it around and **transforms it by His magnificent power and presence.** He forgives totally, 100% your sin condition. Once and forever you become free from the penalty of sin. Moreover, He credits the very righteousness of Jesus Christ into our "spiritual bank account."

Then He begins the work of transformation. He begins to remove guilt and shame, fear and darkness, addictions and toxic behavior, and fills the void with love, kindness, compassion and a sense of His presence.

Romans 8:26-28 (The Message) **"Meanwhile, the moment we get tired in the waiting, God's Spirit is right alongside helping us along. IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHAT TO PRAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE DOES OUR PRAYING IN AND FOR US, MAKING PRAYER OUR OF OUR WORDLESS SIGHS, our aching groans. He knows us far better than we know ourselves, knows our pregnant condition, and keeps us present before God. That's why we can be so sure that EVERY DETAIL in our lives of love for God is worked into something good."**

Psalm 136: 23-26 (The Message) **"God remembered us when we were down, His love never quits. Rescued us from the trampling boot, His love never quits. Takes care of everyone in time of need. His love never quits. Thank God, who did it all! His love never quits!"**

The very heart of the Gospel, the Messianic Good News, is contained in Isaiah 61 (NIV). 750 years plus BC, the prophet Isaiah predicted the words Jesus would use describing His mission. Luke 4:18-19. This is the reason why Jesus came to this world. To display the love of God before humanity and the universe. God promised to turn bad into good for His people!

"The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God,

**to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion—to bestow on them a CROWN OF BEAUTY INSTEAD OF ASHES**, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor."

If you believe God is sovereign, you will never turn into a victim! I have wondered myself many times, why certain things are the way they are. Your feelings and emotions may betray you. People's views may deceive you. But, if by faith, you firmly believe God is in control of every thing, you will rest in Him. You will give up the fight. You will receive the gift of the experiential "Sabbath," (Rest in Hebrew) which is deeper than the simple legalistic observance of a weekly rest. I believe in the weekly observance totally, but **the deeper meaning of the "Sabbath," is a peace, a rest, that moves beyond what the human eye can see and reason can understand.** It is the experience of trust in God. At peace with the disconnected pieces of this life's puzzle.

This is the very point of differentiation between **RELIGION** and a **RELATIONSHIP** with God. Because God wills into a relationship with us, He sees, he suffers, He walks with us. Because He knows, He will turn all things according to His original purpose.

Do you trust God? Do you believe God loves you? Then you know deep down in your heart, that God will bring all good things to happen to those who love Him. God wills into a relationship with us, He sees, he suffers, He walks with us. Because He knows, He will turn all things according to His original purpose.

**"Don't run from suffering; embrace it. Follow me and I'll show you how. Self-help is no help at all. Self-sacrifice is the way, my way, to saving yourself, your true self. What good would it do to get everything you want and lose you, the real you? What could you ever trade your soul for?"** Mark 8: 34-37-The Message

Share with people today, the Good News of a loving God, as if their eternal lives would depend on you. Live and love today, as if this would be your last day on earth! Nothing matters most!

It's absolutely true that when you trust Christ as Savior, and surrender to God, He removes a whole set of problems you used to have—including the nagging guilt, the shame, the fear, and that empty sense of aimlessness in life that used to haunt you.

But we need to understand something else.

This world is broken. People are broken. There are demonic forces driving people to hurt others. There is death, sickness, cancer, the drunk driver on the road, divorce, imperfect DNA, and all kind of maladies caused by SIN.

I am all for positive messages of encouragement. I am all for the promises of God in the Bible, and the reward to faithfulness. I am all for "happy endings" even if not all stories on this earth have a "happy ending." Jesus ended up on a cross. Jesus' disciples, all, except one were martyrs. They died violent deaths.

I am a bit suspicious of preachers who make everything look so good, that you are not prepared for the tests that will come upon you as a follower of God.

The day you surrender to God and put your trust in Him, at that very precise second, you walk into an unknown battlefield—a warfare that will last for the rest of your life. There will be joy and happy moments for sure. **But there will be fierce battles also. There will be cancer. There will be Columbines, there will be Sandy Hook Elementary School, there will be Auroras, and there will be the suffering of innocent people.**

Why? Because not only is there a God who loves you with passion, and has a plan for your life, **but there is also a devil who hates you, and fiercely opposes God's plan. God will at times allow the devil to bring suffering into your life because that is His shaping tool to make you a citizen of His Kingdom. WE don't have the answers now, why this person, and not that one. Why me, and not you. Or why you and not me.**

It's a gospel that promises peace and plenty, but never warns of persecution. It's a gospel that says God wants you to be healthy and wealthy, and never tells you you may become homeless. It's a gospel that says you can so wrap yourself in God's favor that there will always be enough money for what you need and want, a parking space available for you at the mall, and people will all smile and treat you like royalty.

Friend, that is not the Good News of God. I can assure you, the last thing on Paul's mind was, "How can win a lottery ticket? Or how can I make sure I have enough money to deal with the fiscal cliff? Or what kind of gun I should have in my house in case an intruder breaks in? How can I protect my family?" Paul instead said, "Endure **hardship** as a good soldier of Jesus Christ." The **soldier** Paul had in mind was not armed with guns and assault weapons. He was armed with the presence of God. Read Ephesians 6: 10-18.

**Comparison with other followers of God, or people who brag of God's blessings is a very dangerous game.** Don't fall for it.

First of all, because so called "Christians" that are forever claiming blessings, rewards and no "pain," I am not sure are reading the same Bible I read. I say this with all respect. And second, because you don't know God's ways, you don't know that person's heart, you don't know the end of the road. Only God knows it! God is in control of every event on this planet. But He is also in the business of shaping people for eternity.

The essence of the Christian life is knowing God, walking with Him, obeying Him, and enduring the trials and tribulations you face with Him by your side. Trusting him when things go good, and when things turn upside down. That's it!

Following God is about sticking with Him when the sky is blue, where the sun is out, and also when it's filled with clouds or choked with smoke. It's about walking with God through thick and thin, and pressing on through every heartache and trial that happens to come our way. It is about laughing hard, and crying bitter tears, like the parents of innocent kids in Connecticut, and the loved ones of those who were murdered brutally.

**Jesus made it clear that storms will enter every life. Yours and mine.**

**But it is through these storms and hardships and tribulations that we will enter God's kingdom.** Did you know that, Friend?

Luke put it this way: **"And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, 'WE MUST THROUGH MANY TRIBULATIONS ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD'"** (Acts 14:21–22 NKJV).

We don't always welcome a verse like this. It's not a passage we would love to frame and put on the wall of our living room.

We would probably rather frame something that reads, **"Through many days of perpetual happiness, joy, and pleasure we will enter the kingdom of God."** But that isn't Scripture, and that isn't life. Trials and tribulations will come no matter what.

Job said: **"Man who is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble"** (Job 14:1 NKJV). Another version translates it like this: **"How frail is man, how few his days, how full of trouble!"** (TLB) This is so true!

In the Sermon on the Mount, (Matthew 7: 21-28), Jesus told a story about two men who built two homes. One of the builders erected his home on shifting sand by the beach. He had always dreamed with an ocean view. He finally got it. The other guy found a piece of property that was literally a huge rock. He built his house there. The foundations were the opposite of each other.

Time went by, and the guy by the beach had a terrific time. The guy who built the house on the rock had to climb stairs and the house was not right there by the beach. But then the season of storms came. With the storms came the torrential rains, the strong winds, tornadoes, and the waves of the ocean hit the shore with extraordinary force. The storm hit both houses. The house built by the beach collapsed. The one built on the rock stood firm.

The obvious point of Jesus' story is that you and I must build our lives on a foundation that will last, like the one we find in the pages of God's Word.

But here's an application we sometimes miss. The storm came to both lives. The wind beat on both houses. The rain poured on both building sites.

The man who was wise and carefully chose a stable foundation got hit with the same hurricane-force winds as the man who wanted instant gratification and wanted to make sure his friends would choose his house for parties. The view, the convenience of the water, the weather was all attractive at the moment.

No one is exempt from experiencing storms in life. Good things will happen to us, as well as tragic and inexplicable things. Every life will have its share of pain.

As much as we would like to believe otherwise, none of us can take an extended vacation beyond the reach of human suffering and tragedy.

The storms may be the same. Your loved one may die a horrible death. The difference between those who build their lives on God, and those who don't, is that God is in control of the lives of those who trust Him. God can turn scars into stars. God can turn storms into renewed strength for the future. God can bring good out of evil, pain and suffering.

That is what my Bible teaches, and that is what I believe. I know it, because as I look at my own life I would have never imagined God would make me strong through the storms and the dark nights of life.

Romans 8:28 was my dad's favorite verse, and it was the one I read at his funeral a few months ago. He lived his 94 years by this verse. **"And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose"** (NKJV).

A better translation would be, **"He is causing all things to work and to continue working together for good."**

Please notice that this promise is only valid for followers of God.

Life is a process and, as finite beings who live moment to moment, we can't see around the bend. We can't discern God's ultimate purposes.

But we can know this: He is watching and caring—in control and loving us with an everlasting love.


* **Seek God in your personal life! Delight in Him. Remain in His Word and will for your life. You can not be using the world's strategies to succeed in God's Kingdom. You can not be doing your own thing and expect God to come on board with you plan and bless you! He is not a piece of your plan. The big dream must be submitted to Him! You start with God and ask Him to reveal to you, the way He wants you to pursue it. He will do it!**

* Persevere. Don't give up. This promise energizes me every time I read it. Lamentations 3: 25-33 (The Message)

**"God proves to be good to the man WHO PASSIONATELY WAITS, to the woman who DILIGENTLY SEEKS. It's a good thing to quietly hope, quietly hope for help from God. It's a good thing when you're young to stick it out through the hard times.**

**When life is heavy and hard to take, go off by yourself. ENTER THE SILENCE. BOW IN PRAYER. DON'T ASK QUESTIONS: WAIT FOR HOPE TO APPEAR. Don't run from trouble. Take it full-face. The "worst" is never the worst.**

**Why? Because the Master WON'T EVER WALK OUT AND FAIL TO RETURN. if he works severely, he also works tenderly. His stockpiles of loyal love are immense. He takes no pleasure in making life hard, in throwing roadblocks in the way."**


# Your Final Test

Matthew 25:31-46 (The Message). These are the words of Jesus Himself. He told this parable about Himself. \[My comments\]

“When he finally arrives, blazing in beauty and all his angels with him, the Son of Man will take his place on his glorious throne. **Then all the nations will be arranged before him and he will SORT the people out, much as a shepherd sorts out sheep and goats, putting sheep to his right and goats to his left.**

“Then the King will say to those on his right, **‘Enter, you who are blessed by my Father! Take what’s coming to you in this kingdom. It’s been ready for you since the world’s foundation.** And here’s why:

**I was HUNGRY and you fed me,**

\[Church potlucks? Food banks? Food stamps? Welfare? Actual food given to a hungry person?\]

**I was thirsty and you gave me a drink,**

**I was homeless and you gave me a room,**

\[Took a homeless person to your house? Offered meals for homeless people? Served the needs of the homeless? Sold your wealth like Scott Neesan, and go serve the poor in Cambodia? Government assistance to the homeless? Stop judging them as "losers"?\]

**I was shivering and you gave me clothes,**

**I was sick and you stopped to visit,**

**I was in prison and you came to me.’**

“Then those ‘sheep’ are going to say, **‘Master, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?**

\[I love this question... The sheep don't have a clue what Jesus is talking about! Was Jesus just making this up to make them feel good, or what?\]

**WHEN did we ever see you hungry and feed you, thirsty and give you a drink? And WHEN did we ever see you sick or in prison and come to you?’**

Then the King will say, ‘I’m telling the solemn truth: **Whenever you did one of these things to someone overlooked or ignored, that was me—you did it to me.’**

>\[**In other words, if you saw God,** in the eyes of the afflicted, the poor, the homeless, the people struggling with life, the "losers" of our culture, the pregnant teenage girl, the drug addict, the unemployed... If you saw God, and you helped me, you belong in paradise with me forever! That means you love me! Notice that Jesus did not encouraged the sheep to "evaluate" the worthiness of a person before extending a helping hand... Jesus did not say, you must "help people to help themselves," or "teach them how to fish instead of giving them fishes." Just the act of compassion is what matters. God looks at the heart and the motives not your smart evaluation of a situation. I believe there is value in helping people to grow and learn to manage better their resources and abilities to help themselves. **But the original motive of the heart must always be one of compassion, not one of calculated risk!**\]

“Then he will turn to the ‘goats,’ the ones on his left, and say, ‘Get out, worthless goats! You’re good for nothing but the fires of hell. And why? Because—

I was hungry and you gave me no meal,

I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,

I was homeless and you gave me no bed,

I was shivering and you gave me no clothes,

Sick and in prison, and you never visited.’

“Then those ‘goats’ are going to say, **‘Master, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHEN did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or homeless or shivering or sick or in prison and didn’t help?’**

\[Wow... impressive! They had the same question for the King as the sheep, but the reason for the question was totally different! **"God, when were you on those conditions? We never saw you... You know we were a church and we would have helped if we would have seen you? But... God... God... the poor, and the homeless we saw were losers! Yes, we saw them everywhere... but for sure, that wasn't you, God! We had a meal for them once a week, but you did not expect us to see you in them, right? That wasn't good! They were the ones consuming our wealth and hard-earned dollar, God! Our taxes were going to help people who were in those conditions because they chose to be! You know, that, God... We always made sure we tithed and gave a little bit extra to help the poor in Ethiopia... God... You must be mistaken!**\]

“He will answer them, ‘I’m telling the solemn truth: **Whenever you failed to do one of these things to someone who was being overlooked or ignored, that was me—you failed to do it to me.’**

“Then those ‘goats’ will be herded to their eternal doom, but the ‘sheep’ to their eternal reward.”

I don't care if you are religious or not...

If you attend church every week or not...

If you have the truth or not...

If you are a pastor, a high official of a denomination, or a church member...

If you are educated or not...

Wealthy or poor...

If you are careful with your money or not...

If you are struggling with life or comfortable...

If you are making good money or verily making it through...

Are you a sheep or a goat?

**Are you compassionate towards your spouse, your marriage, your kids, the unfortunate people you meet, the people who fail, the people who hurt you? Do you rather forgive or divorce? Do you rather judge or love? Do you rather be right or be found loving?**

> **TRUE "LOVE" AND "SERVICE" ARE ALWAYS COSTLY! They are always sacrificial acts, regardless of the outcome.**

Every time you **LOVE** and **SERVE** in a relationship, in a marriage, as a parent, as a relative, as a family member with your aging parents, as a friend intervening in a marriage conflict, as a first responder, as a police officer, a fire fighter, a Doctor, a nurse, as a Pastor, in the military, as a government official, as you meet "needy people," as you deal with abuse and report it, as you meet homeless people, the sick, people in prison, hospitals, people suffering financial challenges... **EVERY TIME,** you **LOVE and SERVE** you will be **PAYING A PRICE.**

**TRUE "LOVE" AND "SERVICE" ARE ALWAYS COSTLY!**

> **TO LOVE IS TO SIGN A PACT WITH SUFFERING!** (Pastor A. Duarte)

**Suffering in this life is inevitable if you will be a loving follower of God.**

I am not speaking about self-inflicting, neurotic, self-victimizing, inferiority or superiority complex pride that creates its own kind of suffering. These kinds of suffering can only be alleviated by **HUMILITY, HUMBLENESS, LETTING GOD LOVE YOU, AND A SURRENDER TO A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.**

I am talking about the suffering that comes from "true love and service," even if you make mistakes in your mode of "loving and serving." **"TRUE LOVE and SERVICE** are learned as you practice them in real time, real circumstances.

> **WHEN YOU LOVE AND SERVE TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY IN RESPONSE TO THE LOVE OF GOD, YOU ALWAYS WIN!**


# The Last Days

The story of mankind's struggles with God is profound. What's next to come?

You are experiencing the final days of "last days" of this age. Jesus is coming back in the flesh very soon! The Bible gave us a lot of clues about when the end of this age will come, and those signs are all around us! This is very exciting! However, we must wake up

For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. ‘Immediately after the distress of those days ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.  Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. (Matthew 24:27-34)

**There are 4 kids of responses to the "time of the end."**

**1) People who deny and refuse to get involved in prophecies regarding the "time of the end." This is the majority of the world. All 5 largest world religions refuse to deal with "time of the end" because of its complication, fear elements, and in credible diversity.** In live in earthquake land here in Southern California. Yet, the majority of people live like nothing will ever happen, and if the subject gets too serious, they walk away. That's the same response to anything catastrophic predicted in the future. Why do you think Noah preached 120 years, and **NO ONE** except his family were saved? Same today. (Mathew 24:37)

**2) People who obsess over "time of the end" prophecies, theories of interpretation, charts, conspiracy theories, esoteric information, date setting, and predictions.** Very often behind this drive there is an obsession for tangibility, **idolatrous knowledge,** and let's face it an intense lust for results. **Fear** creates results, followers, and **money.** People pay for pleasure and fear.

**3) Denominations, cults, and groups who use "time of the end" information to elevate themselves and define WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG. This approach creates a "we versus the rest" mindset that is also very reassuring. Group mind is very powerful.**

**4) Those honestly accept the main prophetic pillars that point to the "time of the end," but do not obsess over details.** How do you know when you are stepping into a territory not blessed by God? Simple. When 27 other "time of the end" experts are fighting regarding details and they all disagree on the details.

Seek to understand and believe the signs of the times as presented in the Bible. Do not obsessed over details because I promise you, for every detail you believe, someone else will come and tell you, you are wrong!

## Satan's Final Last Days Deception

Your BRAIN, your MIND is the territory the devil seeks; control of the physical just follows the control of your BRAIN.

Look at 2 Corinthians 4:4.

What part of your SELF does the devil blind? Its not the physical eyes, **HE IS AFTER YOUR BRAIN, your MIND!** He wants to slowly align those 100 billion neurons to work efficiently for him, until he gets total possession. The Greek word for mind is "_novhma Noema_", which translates **mental thought or perception, that which thinks.** Here is where Satan fights for control. All for the purpose of blinding you from the truth of God. He uses a variety of tools, strategies, skills to win the battle of your brain.

How you THINK, the inner-person YOU are, guides your perceptions. Here is where Satan is at work, and here is where the Bible warns us to set our guard. God’s word implores with you to protect YOUR BRAIN against the ways of this world, which are demonic in nature.

Satan and his fallen-angels, through the proxy of fallen-humanity, battle for the control of YOUR BRAIN. When a person surrenders to God, their perceptions change, because the Spirit of God, the presence of God, the Holy Spirit is now GUIDING THE BRAIN, THE THOUGHTS, THE MIND, THE WILL in a different direction. Satan looses total control over their mind. The kingdom of God has advanced on his territory.

**"The heart is hopelessly dark and deceitful, a puzzle that NO ONE can figure out.**

**But I, God, search the heart and examine the mind. I get to the heart of the human. I get to the root of things. I treat them as they really are, not as they pretend to be."**

You see, Friend, while religion, morality and culture define what's "right" and "wrong", God always goes deeper! The world says, "Do what your heart tells you. Follow your heart." That is a creed believed by millions today. It is one of the great cultural myths of the Western world, a gospel proclaimed in many movies and songs and television programs and stories. People spend hours watching movies that promote one of the devil's most accepted myths! Not only that, what they wouldn't dare do openly, because of the judgmental legalism and morality they would face, they live, accept, and caress in the depths of their hearts. Thus, their walk with God is incongruent! They follow religion, but in their fantasy world, they follow the devil! God says, "Your heart is deceitful." Even, when it looks like you are obeying the 10 commandments, and have the truth, and follow the truth, and do the religious stuff. (Rich Young Ruler Mark 10:17-27) Under all of that, there is a deeper reality. The condition of your heart is what God looks at! Your heart matters to God, more than your outward behavior! Your heart must be filled by God's presence, and His drive, to do His will, then your behavior will reflect it! I don't believe in judging externals. It is deceiving. Religion does that all the time. Whether it's adultery, homosexuality, abortion or whatever! Externals are always deceiving. When a person surrenders to God, and accepts Him in his/her heart, God changes people from the inside out. There is peace. There is harmony. The fruit of the Spirit blossoms fully. Galatians 5 (The Message) We need a higher standard of authority than our heart, our feelings, our emotions. A higher standard of authority than mere opinion from the culture, from morality, legalism, and religion. We must ask God to seek the depths of our hearts. That takes time. It takes a walk with God. It takes listening to God. It takes a commitment to reading God's Word in its totality. It takes prayer. And above all things it takes a humble heart! The problem we have today is a watered-down gospel. Religion has replaced the radical call of Jesus to look deep into our hearts. That's why religion is so quick to judge some sins such as adultery, **and very, very, very slow to call on the deeper sins of the heart: namely, pride, greed, materialism, money obsession, and insensitivity towards poverty, and injustice.** Because of that, many have a watered-down understanding of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, a follower of God. We have Christians who have become so much like the world, that the world doesn't even want to become like them. Remember Peter? And this is the truth! Have you ever watched Christians in "worldly" circles trying to "fit" and be "cool."? Here is the truth, Friend. What was considered normal followship of Christ in the first and the second century, before Christianity became an institution, would be considered **RADICAL** by today's standards. But that is what we need today: **RADICAL FOLLOWERS OF GOD.** To put it another way, we need followers of God that are willing to stand for God no matter what. We need followers of God that know that the only real **TRUTH** is the one God reveals in the heart! God transforms the human heart. The human heart without God is deceiving. I see all day long the results of behavior caused by the human heart. Give God a chance, Friend! Instead of trying to accommodate the Word of God to our changing culture, we need to accommodate our culture to the unchanging Word of God.

# The True End-Times Community of Believers

The Rise Of The ONE WORLD CHURCH has been in process, but it will be officially sealed on September 23-25, 2015.

The 27th of September (Sunday, most of the Christian religion "Sabbath." The Roman emperor Constantine, a former sun-worshiper, professed conversion to Christianity, though his subsequent actions suggest the “conversion” was more of a political move than a genuine heart change. Constantine named himself Bishop of the Catholic Church and enacted the first civil law regarding Sunday observance in A.D. 321. The Catholic Church admits to the change of "Sabbath" (Saturday) to Sunday by the authority of the Church. Protestants simply follow the Catholic Church, except they "try" to defend Sunday keeping with the Bible...)

The Bible, in the Book of Revelation, warns us that a **POLITICAL-RELIGIOUS LEADER** will arise in the **LAST DAYS** of the history of this world **WHO DRIVE THE WORLD INTO A ONE-WORLD RELIGION.** This is not a new idea. It was predicted 2.000 years in a vision God gave the apostle John in the Island of Patmos.

Revelation 13: 11-18

"I saw **ANOTHER Beast**rising out of the ground. It had two horns **like a lamb but sounded like a dragon** when it spoke. (This "beast" in prophetic terms represents the USA as a world power). **IT WAS A PUPPET OF THE FIRST BEAST,** (The first beast has been traditionally understood to be the Catholic Church)... (The second beast) **made earth and everyone in it worship the FIRST BEAST, which had been healed of its deathblow."** (This last description of the first beast provides us with a historical anchor to know what it means)

The **deathblow** inflicted on the first beast has always been considered the 59 years the Vatican was invaded as a "Papal independent State" and invalidated on September 20th, 1870. The **deathblow** was the abolition of "church-state" kind of government. On February 11th, 1929, an historic treaty was signed between the Italian Government and the Vatican re-establishing the **political power and diplomatic standing of the Catholic Church.** Back to church-state kind of government. The agreement signed 70 years ago by Benito Mussolini and Cardinal Gasparri, on behalf of the King Victor Emmanuel III and Pope Pius XI, restored the full diplomatic and political power of the Holy See of Rome. And today, all the world indeed "wonders" at the revived power of the Roman Catholic Church, which is the epitome of CHURCH and STATE combined in one institution with ambassadors all over the world, its own bank, government entities, and a major player in global politics all under the headship of a political-religious person, namely, the Pope.

**Continues John in the Book of revelation:**

"This second Beast (The USA) worked magical signs, dazzling people by making fire come down from Heaven. It used the magic it got from the Beast to dupe earth dwellers, getting them to make an **IMAGE OF THE BEST** that received the deathblow and lived. It was able to **animate the image of the Beast** (give power to the first beast) so that it talked, and then arrange that anyone not worshiping the Beast would be killed. It forced all people, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or forehead. Without the mark of the name of the Beast or the number of its name, it was impossible to buy or sell anything."

"Solve a riddle: Put your heads together and figure out the meaning of the number of the Beast. It’s a human number: 666."

The second beast (The USA) will have the appearance of a lamb (Revelation 13:11), which means it will **"appear to be a follower of God."** However, in reality he is an impostor and a deceiver. The true identity of the second beast, is the one of the false prophet. His campaign to unite the world’s religions will ultimately lead people of all faiths to come together for the purpose of **WORSHIPING THE FIRST BEAST, THE ANTICHRIST.**

This is what you need to catch. The model of church-state government under the papacy, will be implemented in the United States under the direction of the Vatican. That's what the prophecy says.

Ellen White, prophet of God, said 150 years ago the following:

**"WHEN the leading churches of the United States, uniting in such points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall INFLUENCE THE STATE TO ENFORCE their decrees and to sustain their institutions, THEN Protestant America will have formed an IMAGE TO THE ROMAN HIERARCHY, and the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters inevitably result.”** (Great Controversy, p, 445)

Only a **"political-religious"** leader, following the the model of the Vatican, like the United States could fulfill the requirements of having the appearance of a **lamb and leading the world in worship.**

So believers have been warned in advance to be on the lookout for this movement which I believe is happening very quickly now. Our alarms should be blowing when we see someone taking actions to unite the religions of the world. However, since the Bible does not tell us the dates we are instructed to be on the alert, be sober, aware of the schemes of the devil. We are warned not to be spiritually asleep like those who are in darkness.

The Lord Jesus warned his followers, **“Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour"** (Matthew 25:13). So those who are committed to obeying God should be paying close attention to the events happening in the world around them.

Today we see a religious leader taking action to unify the religions of the world in ways that are unprecedented. His name is Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church.

Pope Francis appears to be on a crusade to unite the religions of the world into one. He started fast from the beginning and has not slowed down. Since being elected Pope on March 13 2013, **he has launched initiatives to reconcile differences between leaders of every major religion, including longstanding rifts between Christian denominations.**


I believe the United States will follow the direction of the Pope in all political affairs, and the direction of the government, beginning September 23, 2015. In fact, I am convinced the next Presidential election will be heavily influenced by Pope Francis' agenda. The United States will order the world to follow the message of the Pope regarding the following issues:

* **The environment**

* **Socio-economic issues. Compassion. What could be more "religious" than to cover the poor, eliminate discrimination, and create a sense of openness to all people. Forgiveness for abortion. Forgiveness for divorce.**

* **A message of love and compassion for sinners which will unite all religions. De-emphasize differences and proclaim the love, the mercy and the forgiveness of God.**


God's last message to the world is a message of compassion, love, mercy and grace.

"Legalistic" denominations with cultic tendencies like to speak of **JUDGMENT.** I believe in judgment. But if the judgment of God is not framed by **GOD'S LOVE,** His **judgment will be used to create FEAR and religious behavior modification which is not healthy.**

Followers of God must be very cautious in calling Pope Francis "demonic." You don't know that! God may be using this man to share God's last message to the world. There is a strong confrontation around the world right now between **compassion,** and **intolerance.** Intolerance is often used under the umbrella of religion. Ask God to give you a spirit of discernment.


>I believe the world will become involved in a "new spiritual revival" like we have never seen before. Under the umbrella or love and compassion there will be great deception and confusion between the **TRUE REDEMPTIVE TRANSFORMING LOVE OF GOD,** and a **SUPERFICIAL RELIGIOUS LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF UNITY.**

The reason why I believe this point is so important it's because God's last message to the world is HIS LOVE... Inviting people to LET HIM LOVE THEM, and allowing the transforming power of His grace to follow Him. I have said this for years. THE DEVIL and GOD will preach the "SEEMINGLY SAME MESSAGE" to the world, and the ones who will know the difference will be those who have a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, away from religion and legalistic dogma.

**"All the world needs is LOVE"** will sound like true religion. There is false love and true love. You can only be a true lover if you let God love you, **FIRST!**

**This is important to acknowledge.**

There will be great tension between **RELIGIOUS LEGALISM on one extreme, (Disenchanted people fighting a religious battle), THE ONE WORLD RELIGION that will influence governments and political moves at all levels, and a** true RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD which calls for true loyal love to Him and His commandments, even unto death. Matthew 25:12 is about to begin its major fulfillment:

Due to FALSE RELIGION, (The ONE WORLD RELIGION. Many in the religions of the world will be disenchanted and will open up to God's love and grace), and the chaos, violence, environmental disasters, and the confusion of the world, MOST people will lose their ability to love and be loved.

* **The world will become a jungle of conflict BETWEEN the absence of LOVE on one extreme, and FALSE LOVE, driven by fear, on the other extreme.**

* **Perhaps a major global attack against ISIS and Muslims who do not surrender to the ONE WORLD RELIGION.**

* **A possible economic global crash.**

* **Persecution against those who remain loyal to God, and refuse to follow the ONE WORLD RELIGION.**

This message of unity has been the ongoing theme by Pope Francis in meeting after meeting, and nation after nation. Pope Francis has not only sought unity among Catholics, but has ventured much farther than any previous Pope in reaching out to people of other religions. This is a pre-requisit for the second beast, the United States, to call the world to follow the Pope.


**"And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed."** (Revelation 13:12)

Believers everywhere should be watching and praying, on the alert, sober and fully awake for the devil comes craftily, cloaked as a lamb. **Vigilant but not rooted in FEAR, legalism and a judgmental spirit.**

Rejoicing because the end is near. Sharing the **GOOD NEWS of God's love with neighbors, family. Loving people, expressing compassion, praying for miracles of transformation. Keeping our marriages and families together under the umbrella of God's grace, healing power, and LOVE.**

The DEVIL and GOD will be preaching the "seemingly same" message in the time of the end. That's why it will be so confusing. The devil just wants to copy, imitate everything God does. The is the false light. 

It's a misconception to believe that the DEVIL will be preaching LOVE, compassion, unification to the world, while GOD calls his followers to preach LEGALISM, RIGIDITY OF DOCTRINE AND DOGMA. I want you to catch the subtlety of what I am saying. 

Don't put your TOTAL TRUST IN END-TIME PROPHECIES, the fear mongering details some Pastors and churches use to create obsessive addiction to details, and predictions of the end. This is all part of what I call RELIGION. Speculation and conspiracy theories run high in the realm of RELIGION. **INSTEAD PUT YOUR TRUST IN GOD. Let God LOVE YOU, and develop a RELATIONSHIP with Him, by surrendering your life to Him! God will never let His people be deceived. Study prophecies for awareness without falling into human obsession!**


The prostitute riding the beast. UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE AS ONE CONTROLLING WORLD POWER.

Revelation 17 is delineated into two parts: (1) the vision (17:1–6a), in which John the revelator observes a woman who is depicted as a prostitute riding the beast; and (2) the audition (17:6b–18), in which the interpreting angel explains to John the meaning of the vision of the prostitute and the beast that carries her.

In the vision, John is invited to witness the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters, seductively deceiving the inhabitants of the earth (vv. 1, 2). This woman is subsequently identified as “ ‘Babylon the great, the mother of harlots’ ” (v. 5).1 In the Hebrew Scriptures, a prostitute symbolically refers to God’s people in their apostasy (Isa. 1:21; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16; 23; Hosea 3; 4). **The portrayal of the prostitute in Revelation 17 shows that she represents an entity that was once faithful to God before aligning herself with the end-time opponent of God and His faithful remnant. Babylon is thus a corporate name for an end-time apostate entity.**

Note that the prostitute is first referenced to as sitting on “ ‘many waters’ ” (v. 1); however, when John actually sees her, she is seen as sitting on a scarlet beast (v. 3). This should not come as a surprise due to such a literary feature occurring regularly in the book (see Rev. 5:5, 6). Therefore, the waters and the beast are two symbols that represent the same reality. According to Revelation 17:5, **the waters upon which the prostitute was seen symbolize UNION of the civil, secular, and political powers of the world.** Remember I spoke about this in my last "Chats." The book of Revelation points us in the direction of **ONE WORLD RELIGION, CHURCH OR POWER** that will control the destiny of the world.

**Jeremiah 51:13 shows that “many waters” refers to the Euphrates River. Just as the ancient Babylon depended on the Euphrates River for its existence, so will the end-time Babylon depend on the civil, secular, and politi­cal powers of the world to enforce its plans and purposes.**

**Furthermore, the beast stands as a symbol of a political power or system. That the prostitute Babylon sits (or rides) on the beast shows that this religious system will have control over these worldwide political powers at the end of time.** End of the separation of church and state, and the "marriage" of state and church in one entity. Thus, the prophecy shows us that at the end of time, there will be a **religious-political union when the political powers of the earth will unite with the end-time apostate religious system named Babylon.**

The three phases of the beast, The beast that WAS, WHO IS NOT, and WHO IS TO COME.

In the second part of the chapter, John is described as greatly aston­ished when he sees the prostitute. He recognizes in her the woman that had fled into the wilderness in order to escape the persecution of the dragon during the prophetic 1,260-day period of the Middle Ages (Rev. 12:13, 14). In response to John’s astonishment, the interpreting angel promises to disclose the “ ‘mystery’ ” of the prostitute and of the scarlet beast that carries her as well as their function at the time of the end (Rev. 17:7).

John describes the beast as the one that **“ ‘was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss’ ”** (v. 8). This identification of the beast brings to mind the divine title **“ ‘who was and who is and who is to come’ ”** (Rev. 4:8). Thus, this title identifies the beast as a parody of God. However, this tripartite formula also shows that the beast has passed through three phases of exis­tence. This, in turn, links the scarlet beast of Revelation 17 with the sea beast of Revelation 13 (cf. Rev. 13:1 with 17:3).2

* **First, the beast “was.”**

In other words, this beast existed in the past. The “was” phase of the beast refers to its activities during the prophetic period of 1,260 days or years (Rev. 13:5). **The year A.D. 538 marked the beginning of this prophetic period when the church of western Europe, led by the Roman papacy, established itself as an ecclesiastical power and dominated the Western world throughout the Middle Ages.** In our time characterized by religious tolerance, such statements can be regarded as harsh and unfair; but the present reality cannot erase the historical facts.

* **Second, the beast came into its** “is not” **phase of existence in 1798 when, as a result of the events of the French Revolution, it sustained its deadly wound (Rev. 13:3).**

This brought an end to the church’s oppressive political power. The beast disappeared for some time from the world’s scene, yet it survived.

* **Third, with the healing of the deadly wound, the beast will resur­rect to life in full satanic rage against God’s faithful people. The prophecy thus shows that the religious-political oppressive system that dominated the world during the Middle Ages will be revived at the time of the end and will dominate the world as it did in the past.**

This revival of the beast will fill the inhabitants of the world with awe and admiration (Rev. 13:8; 17:8b).

Therefore, Revelation 17 clearly describes the sea beast of Revelation 13 at the time when its deadly wound has been healed. Upon this resur­rected beast, John sees the end-time prostitute Babylon sitting. Thus, the end-time religious system that will play a key role in the final conflict is a continuation of the religious-political power that harmed and oppressed God’s people during the prophetic 1,260-day period of the Middle Ages.

I want you to catch this. **Revelation tells us that THE TIME OF THE END WILL BE ALL ABOUT RELIGION. Religion will once again dominate and control politics as it did in the past, even if it's for a short time.**

However, there is a noticeable difference between its power during the medieval period and the time of the end. **While the sea beast, representing the medieval CHURCH, was a religious-political power, the SCARLET BEAST is exclusively a politi­cal power driven by the religious power. These two are distinct at the end of time.**

## The Seven Heads of the Beast

This brings us to our key passage of Revelation 17:9–11: **“ ‘Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits, and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while. The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction.’ ”**

The text opens with a call for **“WISDOM”** as a prerequisite to understanding the meaning of the heads of the beast. The wisdom that John calls for here is the same wisdom that was spoken of in connection with the number of the beast (Rev. 13:18). **This wisdom refers to spiritual discern­ment that can only be imparted by the Holy Spirit, rather than through brilliant mental and intellectual ability (James 1:5).** Only through this divinely imparted wisdom will the faithful be able to discern the true character of this end-time satanic power.

As we continue to read, we may see that the beast has seven heads like the red dragon (or Satan) of Revelation 12:3. The existence of the beast remains inseparable from its heads. Throughout history, the beast has solely ruled and been active through the agency of its heads. When one of the heads receives a deadly blow, the whole beast dies (cf. Rev. 13:12–14). This brings us to a need for a closer look as to what these heads represent.

**“‘The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits’ ”** (Rev. 17:9). We see a new symbol added here. At first, we were told that the woman sat on “ ‘many waters’ ” (v. 1), and then, on the scarlet beast (v. 3); **now, catch this... the angel explains that she actually sits on seven mountains. The waters, the beast, and the mountains are different symbols for the civic, secular, and political powers (cf. v. 15) that will provide popular support to Babylon as the end-time apostate religious system.**

We must keep in mind that Revelation does not deal with INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITIES, whether past or present, but RATHER with systems and world powers—whether political or religious.

The Greek word **"_oros_"** means “mountain,”not “hill,” as some translators suggest in order to show that the city of Rome, situated on seven hills, is in view here. However, since the seven mountains in Revelation 17 are successive, they cannot be interpreted in a literal manner. In the Old Testament, mountains often represent world powers or empires (Jer. 51:25; Ezek. 35:2–5; Dan. 2:35). For instance, the kingdom of Judah in the Old Testament is often referred to as Mount Zion (Ps. 48:1–3; Isa. 29:8).

**The angel clearly does not refer to literal mountains since he immediately explains to John that these seven mountains actually represent “seven kings” (Rev. 17:10).** However, these cannot be interpreted as individual kings, for at least three reasons.

* **First of all, we have established that Revelation does not deal with individual personalities but systems.**

* **Second, these seven kings are equated with the seven mountains—a symbol of kingdoms or empires.**

* **Third, in the Old Testament, “kings” is another expression for kingdoms or empires (Dan. 2:37–39; 7:17).**

### Seven Heads as Successive Empires

Based on biblical evidence, the interpretation that makes the most sense is that the seven mountains, upon which the prostitute Babylon sits, stand for the seven successive empires that dominated the world throughout history and through which Satan worked to oppose God.

**These empires possessed common traits of religious-political governance and coercion, which they used to cause harm and persecute God’s people.**

As the angel further explains to John from his time’s perspective, **5 of these kingdoms have fallen, (WAS), 1 (IS), and the 7th one would appear sometime in the future.** As previously explained, this cryptic text has generated numerous speculative interpretations, primarily due to the interpreters’ failure to note that the meaning of these successive kingdoms was explained to John in the context of his own time—not ours. Nowhere in the text does it indicate that John was transported to another time; the angel simply explains to him what he had already seen previously in the vision.

**THEREFORE, the key to decoding the meaning of these seven heads lies in the sixth kingdom, which is described as “IS.” This “is” refers to John’s time. John lived in the time of the sixth head—THE ROMAN EMPIRE. The five that had fallen were thus the empires that ruled the world and caused harm to God’s people prior to the time of John: (1) Egypt was the world power that enslaved and oppressed Israel, seeking to destroy her; (2) Assyria destroyed and scattered the ten tribes of Israel; (3) Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and exiled Judah; (4) Persia almost annihilated the Jews at the time of Esther; (5) Greece oppressed and tried to destroy the Jews through Antiochus Epiphanes.**

**THE SEVENTH KINGDOM that “HAS NOT YET COME” refers to the medieval papacy that, from John’s time perspective, would be manifested in the future from John’s time—after the fall of the Roman Empire. (PAPAL ROME).**

The angel further explained that the scarlet beast itself is a part of the phase of the eighth head, the world power that is to come at the time of the end. Yet, it is one of the previously noted seven heads. Although this eighth head is one of the previous seven, it is considered a new power. Which of the seven? Most likely the seventh head, which previously experienced the deadly wound but comes back to life after its wound has healed.

**This seventh power will reappear as the eighth head at the end of time and will exercise the same authority as it did during the Middle Ages.** During the time of the eighth head, the scarlet beast carries the prostitute Babylon. We now live in the era of the seventh head, for the eighth head has not yet gained its power. However, it will appear on the world scene at the time of the end and will impose its rule on the inhabitants of the earth.

The EIGHT head must remain a "short time"

Current misinterpretations of this phrase have construed the phrase to mean that the seventh pope will rule for a short amount of time. The Greek adjectival word for the temporal phrase “a short time” used here is **"_oligon_,"** which means “a short time” or “a little while.”

This word (Greek: oligon)is different from **"_micron_,"** used in Revelation to indicate shortness of time (see Rev. 6:11; 20:3). In contrast, Greek: **"_oligon_"** does not indicate a length of time but is rather used in a **qualitative sense.** For instance, Revelation 12:12 states that having been cast out of heaven, Satan realizes that he has only **“ ‘a short time,' Greek:** '\[_oligon kairon_\].’ **But you see, ”this “short time” does not refer to a length of time, for it has been at least 6.000 years, perhaps much more, since Satan’s expulsion from heaven—another way of saying this, is that** Satan’s "time has limits," its has pre-determined time. Just as a person sentenced to death realizes that he or she only has **“a short time”** despite the fact that the execution may take place many years later.

This same meaning for the Greek word Greek: **"_oligon_"** is also found in Revelation 17:10. That the seventh power must remain for a short time does not point to the length of time—a short period of existence; rather, it is a different way of stating that the existence of this power is determined by God (“it must remain”) and that it will come to its end, as is in the case of Satan in Revelation 12:12. **The seventh power will receive a deadly wound: an event that took place with the events of the French Revolution in 1798.**

Here is my strongest conviction about the time of the end and the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. When understood properly, the prophecies of Revelation have PRACTICAL PURPOSES AND APPLICATIONS: to teach us how to live today and prepare us for the future. NOT THE CREATION OF FEAR, AND SUPERIOR ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE that gives you an edge on the rest of the people. A RIGHT understanding of prophecy will inspire and motivate you to reach others with the gospel of God's GRACE, not make you denominationally ARROGANT, full of idolatrous certainty. That is not the spirit of God!

**"God's grace is not defined as God being forgiving to us even though we sin. GRACE IS WHEN GOD IS A SOURCE OF WHOLENESS, which makes up for my failings. My failings hurt me and others and even the planet, and God's grace to me is that my brokenness is not the final word ... it's that God makes beautiful things out of even my own shit. Grace isn't about God creating humans and flawed beings and then acting all hurt when we inevitably fail and then stepping in like the hero to grant us grace - like saying, "Oh, it's OK, I'll be the good guy and forgive you." It's God saying, "I LOVE THE WORLD TOO MUCH TO LET YOUR SIN DEFINE YOU AND BE THE FINAL WORD. I am a God who makes all things new.”** ― Nadia Bolz-Weber, _"Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner"_

I believe there will be two churches in the last stretch of the "time of the end" before the Second Coming of Jesus. **"The parable of the sheep and the goats: TIME OF THE END."** Very few Bible students see a **prophetic message** in this parable. 

**1) All the world's issues at a local and global level will all be about RELIGION.** You must be aware of this!

**I know it sounds impossible, but we are slowly moving into that era.**

Just a careful listening at the events that took place this week in the USA as result of Pope Francis' visit, will give you a glimpse of the future.

The issues we face globally are geo-political conflicts, ecological, environmental, financial disintegration, violence, crime, family values, the increasing number of young people who choose to cohabit instead of marrying, issues of sexuality, pornography, drug abuse, injustice, the value of life, death penalty, euthanasia, incarceration, poverty, discrimination, xenophobia, immigration and disease, among the main themes shaping our political, cultural and global debate. You see, Friend, at the bottom of the global landscape, are the spiritual issues, the issues of the heart, the kind of relational life we choose to live.

It's my conviction that soon or later, all those issues will fall under the umbrella of **RELIGION.** We are almost there. The 5 large religions of the world are speaking to those issues, and in some instances the conflicts we face are driven by religious motives, particularly in the case of the 3 Abrahamic religions which tend to be religions of violence. I believe Pope Francis this week bundled up together the major issues we face under the big themes of God, church, humanity, life, love, compassion, community and the urgency to "rebuild our home."

**2) There will be a FALSE church with FALSE RELIGION.** This is what Jesus and the Bible say.

**3) There will be a TRUE church (God's church) composed by people who LET GOD LOVE THEM, and they respond to God and the world in LOVE and COMPASSION!**

First, let me deal with a religious misnomer, which rolls in the hallways of churches, cults, sects, and denominational gatherings which tend to obsess regarding the details of the time of the end.

**"Time of the end"** experts often tend to define the final conflict of 2 opposite ideologies as a very clear set of beliefs and propositions. They love to do that!

>Such perspective provides people and members of those groups what I call an "idolatrous certainty." What do I mean by "idolatrous"? **A false sense of certainty which you worship as an idol.** Like you go to an exam knowing exactly what will be asked of you, and you expect to know the answers to those questions. The whole emphasis is on dogma, beliefs, doctrines, behavior, "who is right and wrong," and **LEGALISM!** Every word I wrote on my last statement is intended to be there.

### What The End Times Are Really All About

The MESSAGE of the false and the true church of God in the "time of the end" will be SIMILAR on the surface. Thus, causing an ocean of confusion!

**Does this make sense?** There would no confusion if the messages of both churches would be diametrically different, and clearly defined.

Revelation 13:13 (NLT) says that the **FALSE CHURCH** will perform "astounding miracles, even making fire flash down to earth from the sky while everyone was watching." Unless you are totally in tune with God, in a deep relationship with Him, you will be deceived by these manifestations of supernatural power. How will you know what is from God and what is not?

Matthew 24:24 (The Message) says, **"Fake Messiahs and lying preachers are going to pop up everywhere. Their impressive credentials and dazzling performances will pull the wool over the eyes of EVEN THOSE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER."**

This simply means that the "false religion/church" will not show up with manifestations and messages that are seemingly "contrary" to God's message directly. It will be a subtle underground form of deception like what the "serpent did in the Garden of Eden with Eve." (Genesis 3:1).

If God performs miracles, the devil will also perform miracles. If God calls people to worship Him, the devil will also show up encouraging people to worship a "false god." If God says "I love you" the devil will show up and say, "I love you better!" If God shows up and says, "It's all by grace and grace alone, the devil will show up and say, "Ok, that means you are free to do whatever you want!" (Playing games with God is called legalism). The devil is a master at deception, lying and confusing the human mind.

### Confusion in the End Times

**I need you to follow my thought on this, because before you know what is genuine and false you must be patient.** God says that.

I read and heard many people this last week getting ahead of God and saying Pope Francis is the "beast" of the book of Revelation and the multitudes following him are being deceived. I disagree vehemently. I believe that's the spirit of legalism, and **"me right/you wrong"** spirit prevailing, which is not from God.

**Here is the parable Jesus used to stop all "religious experts" from hurrying up to predict what's next, and judge motives.**

Matthew 13:24-30 (The Message)

"He \[Jesus\] told another story. **“God’s kingdom is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field. \[The good farmer is God\] That night, while his hired men were asleep, his enemy \[The devil\] sowed thistles all through the wheat and slipped away before dawn."**

**"When the first green shoots appeared and the grain began to form, the thistles showed up, too."**

**"The farmhands came to the farmer \[God\] and said, ‘Master, that was clean seed you planted, wasn’t it? Where did these thistles come from?’ “He answered, ‘Some enemy did this.’**

**“The farmhands asked, ‘Should we weed out the thistles?’** \[Notice the anxiety driving the farm workers. **They wanted to clean up the field.** They were anxious to define what was good and what was bad! They sound like preachers and religious people trying to define **who is RIGHT and WRONG,** doesn't it? Such anxiety, presumptuous, and arrogant sense of superiority is not from God. Read God's answer to those farm workers (preachers, denominations)\]

**“He said, ‘NO, if you weed the thistles, you’ll pull up the wheat, too. LET THEM GROW TOGETHER...** \[please notice the following\] **UNTIL HARVEST TIME.** \[Don't miss the following statement\]. **THEN...** \[**WHO?,** a denomination, preachers, time of the end experts, a religious sect? **NO!**\] **"I" \[God\] WILL INSTRUCT THE "HARVESTERS" TO PULL UP THE THISTLES and tie them in bundles for the fire, THEN GATHER THE WHEAT and put it in the barn.’”**

Notice the points of Jesus' parable. TWO FARMERS: A good one, and a bad one. THE FARM represents the world. THE FARMERS, the workers of the field paid to keep the soil good, watered, and in good condition. THE FARMERS see the difference between the wheat and the tares, and they want to clean up the field. The GOOD FARMER SAYS, "NO, don't do it!"

Friend, who are the harvesters? at the end of the age?

The original Greek, and most versions such as the NIV, say, **"The HARVEST IS THE END OF THE AGE, and the HARVESTERS ARE (Greek: _"ἄγγελοί"_ ) ANGELS"** So, the "judgment" of God will happen at the end of the age, and until then, unless you are one of God's angels specifically sent to be a harvester, you are not responsible for separating the wheat from the tares. **Do I make sense?"** This is a symbolic image of what will happen at the Second Coming of Jesus.

I believe the subject of this parable is **RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE.** This is Jesus' message told to people who were **anxious to clean up the field!** Have you met any religious person like that?

**Religious tolerance** is about reserving judgment till the **HARVESTER/S** get the job done. We can till, we can garden, we can nurture, we can water, we can argue about whose wheat is the "wheatiest" or whose thistles is the "thistleiest," **(which is mostly what legalism is all about),** BUT **judgment of what is** fruitless and what is fruitful **must be left to the** ONE who is greater than the farmers!

> God is the only ONE who will perform the final judgment. Don't take God's job into your own hands. Aren't you glad, you are not in charge of pulling the tares from the field?

**The 5 parables are prophetic parables because they reveal and conceal the existential reality of the Kingdom of God on earth all the way from the time when Jesus told them to the disciples, to the time of the end.**

The language of the 5 parables follows the "agro-bio-linguistic" mindset of the Hebrew/Aramaic milieu. God meant for His people to walk out unto the world and find manifestations of His universal principles in nature. He used the idea of a potter to explain how He wants to shape us. He used the symbol of the bread, light, salt, birds, plants, flowers, trees, soil, seeds, examples of nature. The parables of Jesus are not linear like the Hellenistic culture, but dynamically alive, rich in meaning, multifaceted, and subtle. They are meant to make you think. They are often counter-intuitive. All 5 parables of Matthew 13 profile from different angles the **two churches at the "end of the age" prior to the coming of Jesus: namely the CHURCH OF GOD, His followers, and the FALSE CHURCH, those who reject His love.**

### Wheat and Weeds

**Because it reveals the VISION OF GOD for those who are RECEPTIVE, while it CONCEALS it from those who are not open to a relationship with Him.**

Jesus is speaking in this parable of **HIS OWN CHURCH, THE CHURCH OF GOD IN HIS TIME.** Up to that moment Jesus ministry was limited to Palestine. He is now opening a new chapter for His disciples to understand. He is revealing that the entire world would be the stage of God's action. Remember that Jesus, the religious leaders, the pharisees of the church, were all part of the church of God at that time. Jesus, by birth was a part of the religious community of the time. He, however, stood up to the official church of His time, and spoke up the truth as a prophet of God. **"He came to his own and they rejected Him"** (John 11:1). He was persecuted, ostracized, and ultimately abandoned at His crucifixion by his own people.

Here is the key to the prophetic nature of this parable.

**"...the knowledge of the SECRETS of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, \[Seekers of God\] but NOT to them \[The religious leaders of the church\]**

"Whoever has, will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables:"

“Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand."

"For this people’s heart \[Religious leaders of the church, pastors, theologians, pharisees, legalists\] HAS become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them."

The word of prophecy is not so much about prediction, as it is about penetrating the hardened condition of the human heart with a critical message from God. The purpose of prophecy is to open the spiritual eyes to the reality of God's will and presence. God's prophetic messages are particularly for His people, as a way to encourage them and direct them.

### The Parable of the Wheat and Weeds

"Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.

**“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’**

“‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”

**"Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “EXPLAIN TO US THE PARABLE OF THE WEEDS in the field.”**

**"He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.** \[God in Jesus\] (Daniel 7:13-14). **The field is the WORLD,** \[not the church\] **and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom.** \[Followers of God\] **The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the END OF THE AGE,** \[The Second Coming of Jesus\] **and the harvesters are angels."**

**The Son of Man** \[God-Jesus\] **will send out his angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom \[the kingdom of God\] everything that causes sin and all who do evil.** \[Noticed that the harvesters will pull out the weeds first\] **They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.**

**"Then the RIGHTEOUS will shine like the sun in the "kingdom of their Father." Whoever has ears, let them hear."**

1) The first thing I want you to notice is the fact that THE BAD SEEDS PLANTED BY THE ENEMY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WAS A MALICIOUS, TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE OWNER OF THE FARM

It was common practice in ancient times to plant bad seed in your enemy's field in the middle of the night. In fact, it was a crime under Roman law. It was an attempt to bankrupt your neighbor's financial status and ruin his family.

Such act was the equivalent of dropping a bomb on your enemy's house to kill him and his family. Throwing bad seed in your enemy's farm, was then what today we would consider a terrorist attack. Malicious to the core.

**That's the nature of the devil's activities.**

The devil is described as a roaring lion (1 Peter 5:8). He is described as the one behind all human conflict. (Ephesians 6:12). Marriage conflicts that destroy families are not just "human accidents." They are masterminded by demonic forces. The devil is a liar (John 8:44). The devil is your # 1 accuser before God. (Revelation 12:10). God does not condemn (Romans 8:1), the devil does. He steals and kills. (John 10:10) While God offers life, abundant life, the devil wants to suck life out of you.

2) The second thing I want you to notice is the UNUSUAL PARADIGM OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

The heartbeat of this parable is a question: **"Should we pull out the weeds?"**

This question goes to the heart of one of the greatest temptations among **religious people wanting to serve God: the impulse to sort the good people from the bad people, the saints from the sinners, the church from the world, the saved from the damned.**

**Churches and religion are full to the brim of this sort of thing. Righteous crusades to weed out the sinners.**

But what does the farmer say?

The farmer says, **Don't get into the weeding business.** If you do, you'll pull up the good with the bad. Here is the principle to remember.

WEEDS ARE NOT GOOD, FOR SURE! BUT WEEDING? WEEDING IS WORSE. WEEDING IS FORBIDDEN IN THE ILLOGICAL, UPSIDE- DOWN KINGDOM OF GOD

So just let the good and the bad live alongside each other. Trust that God will sort it all out in the end. **Sorting saints from sinners isn't your job. So let it be.**



Just imagine a bunch of followers of God, mingling with people without the anxiety to decide "who is right, and who is wrong?"

**And let's be clear. The farmer has lost his mind according to the laws of farming. I know. It's illogical. It goes against sound agricultural practice.** What farmer doesn't weed? What the workers are suggesting is the **RIGHT THING TO DO.** From a farming perspective the farmer is an idiot. But you see, while **RELIGION** teaches you what's right and wrong, God shows you His heart! That's the key to life in His Kingdom.

Against all logic the farmer says, **Leave it alone. Let the weeds and the wheat grow together. On this farm we aren't going to weed.**

But isn't this a recipe for disaster? Doesn't God need our help in sorting out the good guys from the bad guys? Doesn't God need spiritual leaders with spiritual discernment to monitor the borders of the Kingdom? Doesn't God need a strong wall in the border to only allow "legal" people to walk in? Isn't that common sense? What about some religious drones since we are at it?

**Apparently not, according to God. Our job, it seems, is simply to live alongside each other, wheat and the weeds.**

And here is the truth you and I must understand. I think a part of God's illogical logic in saying "no weeding here" is that we're horrible, often tragically so, in making these distinctions. Who are the real good guys? Who are the real bad guys? Are churches getting this distinction right?

My take: I think the churches, religion, denominations, sects, Christians, get this wrong more often than they get this right. Churches, way more than they'd care to admit, get into the weeding business only to discover that they can't tell the wheat from the weeds. The more tight their dogmas and doctrinal beliefs are the more they are tempted to weed the farm.

More, I'd go on to make this very provocative statement:

TO GET INTO THE WEEDING BUSINESS, AGAINST GOD'S WILL, IS WHAT MARKS YOU AS WEED. Ouch.... WEEDING IS WHAT MAKES YOU ONE OF THE BAD GUYS IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD.

Robert Capon, in his book **_"Kingdom, Grace, Judgment: Paradox, Outrage, and Vindication"_** in the Parables of Jesus has an interesting observation about this parable. Specifically, he notes that the **root of the Greek word--_"aphete"_\--translated as** _"let"_ **in the command of the farmer** ("LET both grow together") **has two related meanings in the Bible. One meaning is the meaning found in the translation of the NLT, the notion of** _"to permit"_ **or** _"to allow_." **But the more common meaning of** _"aphete"_ **in the Bible is** _"to suffer"_, _"to endure"_, _"to tolerate"_, and _"to forgive."_ **This last interpretation adds profound meaning to the words of the suffering Farmer. It introduces us to the infinite pain of God.** This is the word Jesus uttered from the cross: "Father, _"forgive them"_ (Let them off the hook), for they know not what they do." **This concept, paradoxically re-interprets the paradigm of the religious hell. It's veiled by the unimaginable** PAIN OF GOD.

This concept really magnified for me the entire meaning of this parable, as a subversive glimpse of the Kingdom of God.

Suddenly I was reminded that any religious "nut" can do weeding against the will of God. Anyone can judge. Anyone can get into the religious weeding business. In fact, there is good money in that business! All you need is a degree from a seminary, a bunch of fanatics, zealots Pharisees, enough paranoia, some conspiracy theories, and there you go... **"Let's weed the farm once and forever."** It sounds like persecution? Doesn't it?

**Rather than weeding the farm, the farmer is asking the workers to forgive the weeds, to SUFFER THEIR EXISTENCE. This is tough!**

We might say this upside-down parable of the Kingdom is presenting us with two visions of Kingdom life.

* **On the one side are the weeding Christians, those wanting to identify, sort out and burn the weeds. Define dogma and doctrine. "Decide who is for us and who is against us." Identify the bad guy in the kingdom.**

* **And on the other side are the TRUE FOLLOWERS OF GOD WHO LIVE ALONGSIDE THE WEEDS, DEAL WITH THE MESS, THE ENTANGLED ROOTS but manifest the grace of the Farmer, the forgiveness and the mercy of the Farmer, and they are tolerant and patient as the Farmer is.** They are the real good farmers. They obey the Farmer. They follow Him. They have a relationship with Him and know the Farmer's heart. **They would rather LOVE and SUFFER, than to be RIGHT and be UNLOVING!**

And, you and I know this: the weeding Christians and religious people will always have all the best arguments on their side. Forget "winning" a debate with them. "Weeding," they say, "is good farming practice. It makes sense to keep the next generation in line. It's the sensible and right thing to do."

But, you see, Friend, **the logic of forgiving, enduring, tolerating, LOVING the weeds and allowing them to grow alongside? That's no logic at all.**

This parable has profound implications as to how we, at **"Life Center"** approach the people who come to us. If I read this parable right, God calls us to proclaim His message of love, grace, transforming power to **ALL** alike. This parable reminds me I don't know who is **"wheat"** and who is **"weed."** I must be inclusive, welcoming, loving, compassionate, merciful, gentle to all people. In fact, as a Pastor I must make sure that "farmers" are not out there pulling "weeds." Those "farmers" are the darkest secret of churches who consider themselves to be carriers of the "truth of God." They are the modern Pharisees. They are the ones who want to stone the woman caught having sex. They judge the Zacheous of this world. They are quick to judge the woman who crawls under the table to anoint Jesus' feet with a mix of perfume and tear of gratefulness.

Let the paradox sink in, for you are in the farm... **It's only the foolishness of the cross that explains this upside down parable of Jesus.**

* There will be a large visible "church" or world religion that will desperately attempt to save the world, the planet by a mix of religion, technology, science and politics. It's not hard to believe it, if you are watching the way things are rolling now.

* There will be, I believe, a fragmented, invisible, perhaps underground church that will be persecuted for for resisting to worship a false system of salvation.

### The Parable of the Wheat and Weeds

"Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.

**“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’**

“‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”

**"Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “EXPLAIN TO US THE PARABLE OF THE WEEDS in the field.”**

**"He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.** \[God in Jesus\] (Daniel 7:13-14). **The field is the WORLD,** \[not the church\] **and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom.** \[Followers of God\] **The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the END OF THE AGE,** \[The Second Coming of Jesus\] **and the harvesters are angels."**

**The Son of Man** \[God-Jesus\] **will send out his angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom \[the kingdom of God\] everything that causes sin and all who do evil.** \[Noticed that the harvesters will pull out the weeds first\] **They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.**

**"Then the RIGHTEOUS will shine like the sun in the "kingdom of their Father." Whoever has ears, let them hear."**

I wrote previously,

1) The first thing I want you to notice is the fact that THE BAD SEEDS PLANTED BY THE ENEMY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WAS A MALICIOUS, TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE OWNER OF THE FARM

2) The second thing I want you to notice is the UNUSUAL PARADIGM OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

**Today, I want to point out two more aspects of this parable:**

3) The third thing I want you to notice in this parable is the NATURE OF THE WEED.

The New American Standard Bible translation of the Bible makes this point clear. Matthew 13:41 (NASB)

The Son of Man (God-Jesus) will send forth His angels, and they will gather OUT OF HIS KINGDOM (God's Kingdom) ALL STUMBLING BLOCKS (Those who cause others to fall, sin, block their relationship with God), and THOSE WHO COMMIT LAWLESSNESS. (Those who act, behave, and conduct themselves outside of the LAW OF LOVE)

**1) The weeds are described by Jesus as STUMBLING BLOCKS.**

**Stumbling blocks stop people from pursuing their journey. They slow people down. They cause them to fall.** In this particular context the **"weeds"** make it difficult for the **"wheat"** to grow. This is a great image of what God's people face in the open field of a broken world. You may be weed in a marriage. Or someone may be weed in your life. Make no mistake. The devil and the weed will make sure you suffer, slow you down, and get you discouraged.

This very interesting prophetic aspect describes the **very demonic nature of the "weeds."**

**"Weeds" (people who are not walking with God) make the message of God hard to understand.**

Weeds are represented by the suffocating influence of **RELIGION,** the same way it was while Jesus was on this earth.

Weeds complicate the perception of God. They **"doctrinize,"** they **"dogmatize,"** they **"theologize,"** God! They focus on the dark aspects of the unknown instead of offering hope for the present. They rather be right about a prophetic interpretation than to feed the homeless and the hungry. Their values are upside down.

The farm is supposed to be about life, abundant life. The wheat are organically living and growing to produce a good crop. Yet, the constant intent of he weed is to suck life from the same soil to kill.

The weeds, like cancer cells suck up the life of the body, to kill. **They are ANTI-LIFE, but they need LIFE to pursue their ANTI-LIFE movement.** :-) No description could be more accurate to describe the presence of demonic forces in the world and the spirit of the bad farmer who planted bad seeds in the middle of the night.

Someone said to me today talking about the book of Revelation, **that many Christians read the book and become** "beast-centered" **instead of being** "lamb-centered." Great linguistic image! The beast is a defeated foe in the presence of the lamb, if you read the last page of the story.

Where people need love and compassion, the weeds plant fear and darkness. When someone speaks of love, compassion, taking care of the poor, the weeds see someone suspicious! "Wonder what this person is all about? Too simple. Only love and compassion? Anything deeper? More substance?"

The weeds long for charts, dark conspiracy theories, and date setting. Where hope is needed the "weeds" crash it with fear. Where truth is called for, the "weeds" edit videos and movies to scare people. The "weeds" are malicious! Their agenda is to bring to a halt the growth of the wheat. They are set on bankrupting the good farmer and His family.

Whatever you do, which discourages people from letting God love them, **makes you a weed.** The weeds are all about religion and low on relationships. Weeds twist and create a false image of God.

**2) The weeds, say Jesus, commit LAWLESSNESS.**

The Greek word for **"_lawless_"** is **"_anomos_"** (a=without; nomos=law; and thus anomos means **"without law or lawless"**). In the New Testament this word is translated in different ways ("lawless," "unlawful," "wicked," "transgressor") but it always conveys the basic meaning of **"lawless."**

What is **"lawless?"** Let's go deeper. "Lawlessness" is limited in its meaning to the context of the Biblical narrative. For you never have a total vacuum of laws. You either have **"organizing laws," "organic laws that enable life," "purposeful laws,"** or you have **"destructive laws," "chaotic laws, that kill life and wholeness."**

You see, Friend, this specific kind of "lawlessness" is the absence of **God's purposeful order, harmony, predictability, and relational wholeness.**

What would happen if the law of gravity would stop working? Can you imagine? The absence of such law would creates a vacuum for the law of anarchy, complete chaos, loss of living purpose. You get the idea!

Let me use again the example of cancer. Cancer is simple a **"wild cell that chooses to go organically lawless."** A cancer cell goes against the laws of life. But it needs "life" to perpetrate its destructive activity. So it sucks the life of the body and reproduces. If successful, it will drain the life of the body and kill it by a law of destruction.

That's what the"weeds" of Jesus' parable are all about. When people talk about obeying the 10 commandments as the mark of God's people I increasingly feel it's such a "cheap," anemic image of something which is much greater. "Weeds" live by different "laws." The "wheat" grows by the law of purposeful life, which is to produce grain. The "weeds" grow by laws that look similar to the wheat but their purpose is totally different. "Weeds" will entangle the roots of the wheat and kill them if they can.

Here are 3 thoughts I want to leave with you:

* **First. The weeds are the seed of the devil in the farm of this world. They are all over the place mixed with the wheat.** God is love. His law is **RELATIONAL WHOLENESS OR LOVE.** The devil is the **anti-LOVE** force of the universe. As love creates wholeness, the absence of love creates dualism, fragmentation, **DIS-EASE,** cancer, and brokenness. The weeds are living in open rebellion to the very foundation of God's Kingdom. In the Bible that condition is also translated as "iniquity" (Matthew 13:41- KJV)

* **Here is my second thought. If the "weeds" are "weeding" the field, they are disobeying God's order, even though they may keep the 10 commandments. Isn't that an interesting predicament for law abiding religious people?** You are lawless according to the law of God's life and love, if you are wedding the farm. You are on your own. You are operating by your own laws...

The owner of the farm forbids **YOU, ANY CHURCH, DENOMINATION OR RELIGIOUS GROUP TO PULL THE WEEDS!** So the important question here is not: **Who are the weeds? (Which is mostly what religion does), but how do you know if YOU are wheat or weed?** History is full of examples of groups and sects that grew up to "clean up the field" and they failed. It's not God's purpose. Sometimes God allows a movement to be born for a purpose, for a time, to strengthen the wheat of the field, not to become "weed killers" by turning into a massive corporate organization.

By the way, the religious weed killing business, last I heard, was doing pretty well financially. People pay good money for "weed killing." :-) You would amazed how profitable the business is. Weed killers feel good when they are busy cleaning the field. They become weed!

* **Here is my third thought. If you are "LOVELESSLY" obeying the 10 commandments you may be "LAWLESS."** This comes as a shock to some.

The entire law of God is invalidated by the very absence of what the law is supposed to direct you into: **LOVE.** The law is a mirror of what matters to God, LOVE! The law is supposed to show you WHOM you need in your life to LIVE forever!

People ask me all the time: **"Is it possible to observe the 10 commandments and be lost?"** Sad answer. **Absolutely. Of course it possible!** You can be "good" or "bad" measured by the 10 commandments and still be lost.

**LOVE** is what distinguishes the **lawful activity of the wheat, and the lawless life of the "weed."**

Remember 1 Corinthians 13: 1-3? You can do some pretty amazing things and be very unloving. You can be a moral **RAMBO** and yet be empty of love.

Remember the **"Rich Young Ruler"** who came to Jesus? He kept the 10 commandments perfectly! Here was the perfect candidate to expand Jesus' ministry! The disciples were so shocked... They said, "Jesus, how can this be? If this guy is lost... who can make it?" They were still learning the basic lessons of law obedience," and "life relational wholeness" that only comes as a gift of God's grace!

There was only one little thing missing in this powerful, wealthy guy's religious "To Do List." **BE LOVING!** He lost it all! (Luke 18:18-22)

4) The fourth thing I want you to ask yourself in view of this parable is this: HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE WHEAT OR WEED?

**1) Matthew 13:37, says, "The good seed, these are the sons \[and daughters\] of the Kingdom.**

This is interesting. In the parable of the soil, the "seed" is the message of God. (Matthew 13). In this parable of the "wheat" and the "weed," the "seed" is the very life of God planted in the soil. **The DNA of these "seeds" is of divine nature.** You have been born of God. You have been declared perfect by God since the times of eternity (Ephesians 1) and you have let God love you. God's DNA is growing you. You belong to God's family.

**2) The seeds of God are planted in the world. There is no safe nest or castle for "weeds". God is letting you and I know that we will be growing in the midst of "enemies." It gets tough out there in the field. There is no safe ground just because you are "wheat." Weeds abound and God does not encourage you to fight them, debate them or pull them off.**

The most effective form of evangelism happens when you are planted in the world not in a pot by yourself or a bunch of Pharisaical seeds! The best mark of a Pharisees or a bunch of them is this: **ISOLATION, and a drive to identify, mark, deprive of water, and pull if at all possible the WEEDS out of the farm.**

**3) If the weeds, are stumbling blocks, make other people fall away from God, and block their relationship with the true God of love and grace, THE WHEAT WILL INSTEAD ATTRACT PEOPLE TO THE AUTHENTIC GOD!**

The "wheat" are like magnets of life. I love the stories of Jesus. How He attracted people. The Samaritan woman. The wheat manifest love, compassion, empathy, they walk in the shoes of the broken. They bring the healing of God to the suffering and people who live in the margins of the culture. **The wheat speak with the distinctive tone of the God who is a Shepherd.**

The wheat are God's **TRUE CHURCH** in the world. The wheat **DON'T SPREAD FEAR, USE FEAR TO ATTRACT PEOPLE.** Fear is not from God. (1 John 4;18) Condemnation is not from God (Romans 8:1)

**Shame, condemnation, fear, legalism, rigid rules, an angry demanding God, dogmatism, and a judgmental spirit, are all functions of RELIGION, thus they belong in the category of weeds!**

**4) If the "weeds" represents "lawlessness," the "WHEAT" REPRESENT THOSE WHO HAVE LET GOD LOVE THEM, AND THEY ARE ABLE TO RESPOND TO GOD IN LOVE, BY OBEYING HIS LAWS, BY LOVING PEOPLE.**

It's simple. Jesus said, **"IF you LOVE ME, KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS, not the other way around!** (John 14:15). Religion says, keep the commandments to show you love God! God cares about a relationship with you first.

John 13:35 says, **"In this, the world will know you are WHEAT, they will know you are MY TRUE CHURCH...,IF you LOVE!"** There is is a big **IF** again! The absence of love immediately reveals you are weed!

Two living organisms, the weed and the wheat, living by different laws: **One grows to produce good crop, the other to produce nothing... just make the life of the wheat as miserable as possible!**

**In the end false religion will not be about false doctrines but the ABSENCE OF LOVE** (Mathew 24:12 - The Message)

Do you trust the farmer (Jesus Christ) to keep you healthy, vibrant, alive in the midst of the weeds until the harvest time?

# A Warning About the Mark of the Beast

At some point, the Bible seems to predict that managed communism will take over the world, and God’s people are instructed not to conform, but that this will result in much fleshly tragedy.

The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666. (Revelation 13:15-18) 1

Being obedient to God will mean the difficulty of not being able to buy and sell. Being able to buy and sell will mean the uncomfortable reality
of being at odds with God, and the consequences of this choice. What is it about this mark for God to use such a strong warning? 

The most obvious takeaway from this is, do not allow yourself to be physically marked and brought into any sort of slavery to mankind, such as a smartwatch or an embedded chip that monitors your activity and pays you for labor not even if it becomes required by law in cooperation with vaccination tracking. Even getting a vaccination, chip or signing your name to a false contract could be seen by God as giving ownership over to Satan. Your sole dependency should be on God! If you believe in Jesus, you have been bought by the Blood of Jesus and you should never give yourself over to anything that attempts to claim ownership over you. But this also applies to receiving a "mark" in the spiritual realm, receiving a “mark” on the right hand (willful action) or forehead (mindset), or attending a false man-made religious system (such as worshiping the Earth for the sake of climate change). Do not cling to the world, religion or mankind's systems of control, but instead cling to the kingdom of God and to the true King.

Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to preach to the inhabitants of the earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people; and he said with a loud voice, “Fear God [with awe and reverence], and give Him glory [and honor and praise in worship], because the hour of His judgment has come; [with all your heart] worship Him who created the heaven and the earth, the sea and the springs of water.” (Revelation 14:6-7, Amp)

Worship can also be obedience, allegiance, attention, even work. So, God takes who we give control/surrender and ownership over our life to very seriously. Only Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who is Lord and God is truly worthy of obedience, allegiance, praise, and affections!

The only safeguard against the mark of the beast is to have your name written in the Book of Life. To have our names written in the Book of Life is the greatest honor that can be given to mankind because it is the only way to enter Heaven, and Jesus washing away our sins is the only way to be written in the Book. Learning to walk with God starting now is very important. Practicing to trust in Him for the little as well as the big things of everyday life starting now will be critical. It will be
impossible to suddenly trust God at the enforcement of the mark of the beast when one has neglected to do so before then. Time and trust have to be invested in your relationship with God as in any other important relationship in your life, the one with him being the most important. To make a stand for God, even in the face of severe hardship and possibly, death, will require an unshakable faith to endure to the end. Only by Christ's help are we going to endure to the end. He will provide for us
when we cannot provide for ourselves; He will fight for us when we cannot fight for ourselves and, He will deliver us when we cannot deliver ourselves. The following are promises that He will be with us no matter what is coming: [20] “...I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen. Matthew 28:20.

We have been promised a life which seems impossible when
we consider our unpleasant reality on this earth, but
thankfully, “The things which seem impossible with men are
possible with God.” Luke 18:27. “Eye has not seen, nor ear
heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which
God has prepared for those who love Him.” 1 Corinthians 2:9.
What does God have in store for those who choose Him?
No more death
[4] And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there
shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be
no more pain, for the former things have passed away.
Revelation 21:4.
[11] ...He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second
death. Revelation 2:11.
[6] Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first
resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but
they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with

# Aliens are Demons

It’s clear that in the last days, there will be much confusion and deception about what is really fact, true and what is false. People will call good evil and evil good. There will be a false light, a righteousness that seems right but lacking in power. The Antichrist will produce lying signs and wonders, manifestations. 

Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. (2 Cor. 11:14)

Spiritualism, New Age movements, humanism all have their roots in demonic deception of self-worship and self-love. The New Age movement is part of the coming New World Order and may become an official “state” religion. This call will be further strengthened by UFO activity, with a supposed contact
with aliens, so that we can be merged with an intergalactic
civilization. The New Age Movement is seeking to bring all religions together to homogenize religions across the world and prepare them to receive the One World Church (Globalization of Religion)

In the Book of Enoch it says that the leader of the fallen angels was called Azazel, and he is often identified with Lucifer (the Lightbringer) or Lumiel (‘the light of God’).

The Galactic Federation of Light is the big push of the New Age Movement. Their story, these supposed masters are here to help humanity ascend to the next level. The Galactic Federation of Light is a deception of the evil side, and a part of the grand delusion, they serve both sides.

With one accord the so called ‘aliens’ are calling for a false love, false peace. The so called ‘love’ they are calling for is natural human love based on evolution. This is the grand delusion that Satan and demons disguised as aliens are going to deceive the world with. The mind is the last frontier that man thinks he can conquer. To prove it, God will allow Satan to throw every supernatural power he has at man to deceive them, because they rejected the only way to the truth there was; the strait gate and narrow way. The grand delusion is designed in such a way as to prove to man that he is a "god". The fallen church will plunge headlong into this delusion, and in fact has already by and large embraced parts of it.

The only way to find freedom from the lies is to love the eternal Word of God and keep it in your heart. People, culture, society changes but God does not.

# New Heaven and New Earth

When the final judgment has been completed following the 1,000-year peaceful reign of Jesus, the Bible says that God will roll up Earth and the heavens like a scroll, and a "new heaven and earth" will appear, with the "New Jerusalem" coming down out of heaven from God. God's dwelling place will then be among His people on the new earth. His beautiful and eternal dwelling place is described in Revelation 21-22.

Thus will begin a whole new chapter in this story God is writing. We have no idea what happens next, but we can be assured that we will spend eternity with our savior, ruling and reigning with Him as he continues to create and do new things!

# Share This Message

Once you choose to accept His blessing, He then calls YOU to GO OUT and tell others of the wonderful Kingdom News. This is the test of your gratefulness! If you are passionate about the God who loves you, you will be equally passionate about sharing such blessing with others. May I invite to consider your risk taking adventure. Will people walk into the Kingdom of God because of you? Will you impact someone's life with a more positive view of relationships?

My prayer is that you will choose this moment to follow Him no matter what! Do not be afraid! Only trust Him no matter what! Amen

**"LOVE" is ENOUGH... "GRACE" is ENOUGH... "YOU" are ENOUGH... Because God IS "ENOUGH"!**

Let God Love You! Live Loved. The Best is Yet to Come. Never Give Up.
