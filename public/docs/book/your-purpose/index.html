			<p><strong>There are no accidents in God&rsquo;s universe, Friend</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;We humans keep brainstorming options and plans, BUT God&rsquo;s PURPOSE prevails.&rdquo;</strong> Proverbs 19:21 (The Message)</p>
<p><strong>Everything, is either caused by God, or allowed by God. You either believe in the supreme, unlimited, power of God or not! You either believe that when you surrender to God, He takes over totally, or you live with a part-time God the rest of your life.</strong></p>
<p>Our human understanding has a limited comprehension of such God, who loves, cares, produces miracles, intervenes, protects, allows painful experiences to happen.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. BUT ONE THING I DO: FORGETTING WHAT IS BEHIND AND STRAINING TOWARD WHAT IS AHEAD, I PRESS ON TOWARD the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</strong> Philippians 3:13-14 (NIV)</p>
<p>Forgetting the <strong>PAST,</strong> looking <strong>FORWARD,</strong> I <strong>PRESS ON.</strong> Can you feel the force behind these words, Friend? Total focus. Total singleness of mind and purpose. Only <strong>ONE THING</strong> matters: To press on!</p>
<p>Let your entire life be rooted in God. Question everything with the eyes of one who knows God. Check everything through the filters of God&rsquo;s presence in the here and now. Accept everything in faith, believing that somehow there is a reason for such event. Romans 8:28 holds the key to the best life ever! Nothing in life gets better than trusting in God.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And we know that all things work out for good for those who love God.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This promise does not say, that everything in life will be pleasant. This is not an unconditional promise, either. It only applies to followers of God. This promise is for those who believe God is powerful to turn an ugly divorce into a better life. This promise is for parents who suffer for the life a child has chosen to live. God will bring gold out of the fire. This promise is for those who believe God can turn ashes into beauty. This promise is for those who believe their mistakes, sins, a horrible, painful past, can be turn into a blessing to bless others.</p>
<p>“Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won&rsquo;t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. <strong>YOU HAVE TO LOVE. YOU HAVE TO FEEL. IT IS THE REASON YOU ARE HERE ON EARTH. YOU ARE HERE TO RISK YOUR HEART.</strong> You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.” (<strong>&quot;<em>The Painted Drum</em>&quot;</strong> by Louise Erdrich)</p>
<p>The Bible says that your heavenly Father has a plan for each of our individual lives (FathersLoveLetter.com). To fulfill that plan is nothing less than ultimate success in life. But we need to hear Him, so that He can lead us into His plan for our lives. But to do that, we need to be connected to Him through a personal loving relationship.</p>
<p>God loves you with an everlasting love and wants to bless you and fellowship with you!</p>
<p>But Christ proved God’s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly! (Romans 5:8, TPT)</p>
<p>Why should you care? Well, because deep down you know you are accountable to God because God has placed the desire for love and eternity in every heart.</p>
<p>God has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart (Ecc. 3:11, NLT)</p>
<p>Jesus Christ not only loves you and proved it but also claimed to be I AM, the one and only Living God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will never get greater satisfaction that to become a seeker of God&hellip; a seeker of His love&hellip; a seeker of the principles that govern His Kingdom!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God tells us in Jeremiah 29:13, <strong>&ldquo;And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.&rdquo; If you are also a true seeker, if you want to know the true God, then He will reveal himself to you too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>God uses all kinds of vessels to reveal His glory</strong> — big vessels and little vessels, ornate vessels and plain vessels, very expensive ones and very ordinary ones. They all serve a purpose!</p>
<p><strong>God wants to do something great with your life in the near future.</strong> Did you know that? He wants to use the <strong>&ldquo;Gospel according to Friend&rdquo;</strong> and tell people about His power to transform. He wants you to be His story to the people of your world.</p>
<p>Two things are required:</p>
<p><strong>1) Honesty. Own your world. Own the dark part of your life. Stand up and say to yourself: I am responsible for everything I am feeling right now.</strong> In the name of Jesus, I will stop blaming people. I will stop victimizing myself. <strong>I will ask God to overcome the demonic forces that have been keeping me chained to my past!</strong> I will stop feeling shameful, guilty, and I will assume responsibility for everything that happened in my life&hellip; Whether I was guilty or not. Over! New page. New chapter. I got God, the Creator of the universe, on my side!</p>
<p><strong>2) Surrender your past to God. Everything. Your sins. Your mistakes. Your sins of omission and commission. The people who hurt you. The people you hurt. SURRENDER ALL TO HIM</strong> Go ask people forgiveness in the power of God. Dial that number and call. Go knock on a door. Tell people, <strong>&ldquo;I am sorry. I hurt you. Would you forgive me? I want to live for God from now on.&rdquo;</strong> The bible calls that act, <strong>confession.</strong> Confession is the act of giving to God all the bad stuff you have done. Confession means asking people forgiveness for sinning against them. Confession gives you a new chapter. Confession means you have nothing to hide. You are a clean vessel. Confession means <strong>YOU TRUST GOD!</strong></p>
<p>Augustine once said, <strong>“The confession of bad works is the beginning of good works.” We start by dealing with our past. The Bible says,</strong> “If we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do right: he will forgive us our sins and PURIFY us from all our wrongdoing” (1 John 1:9 TEV).</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CHOICES DETERMINE YOUR POTENTIAL</strong>. Here is the key to the best <strong>CHOICES</strong> of your life: GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE FOR YOU! I have found out that there are different <strong>quality</strong> of choices people make. The best <strong>quality</strong> is born in the soil of people who have <strong>CHOSEN</strong> God&rsquo;s purpose. Their choices seem to reflect the heart of God. Love and commitment to people above their convenience. Service to others above financial gain. A readiness to stand for God at the expense of popularity. A choice to the fresh revelation of God&rsquo;s will instead of the stale predicaments of irrelevant religion. Whatever you are facing right now, friend, <strong>MAKE A CHOICE.</strong> Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God&rsquo;s purpose! If you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one <strong>CHOICE</strong> that will transform your life forever! And it is not RELIGION! Whatever you are facing right now, friend, <strong>MAKE A CHOICE.</strong> Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God&rsquo;s purpose! If you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one <strong>CHOICE</strong> that will transform your life forever!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing the devil wants more than to have disoriented about your destination, confused about your purpose for your life NOW, obsessed with the future, and/or feeling guilty about your PAST life or even yesterday!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things that I often confront in dealing with people is their inability to define their PURPOSE because of guilt and shame. The devil will do every possible thing to tempt you into something he can later on blame you for. Have you found that out? He uses people to accuse you, to make you feel like to have no right to get up in the name of God, and fulfill your purpose. That attitude is always demonic.</p>
<p>Anything that distracts your pivotal relationship with God, and your purpose for this life, is demonic and RELIGIOUS!</p>
<p>Here is the call from Jesus to fulfill your purpose in the next DECADE. Matthew 5: 13-16-The Message</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you why you are here. You&rsquo;re here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? You&rsquo;ve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another way to put it: You&rsquo;re here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We&rsquo;re going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to hide you under a bucket, do you? I&rsquo;m putting you on a light stand. Now that I&rsquo;ve put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand—shine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, you&rsquo;ll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ask God to transform your life, (Galatians 5-Fruit of the Spirit-The Message), cleanse you by His GRACE, and then claim your PURPOSE for the next decade.</p>
<p>Being salt and a light for God, in this world calls for audacity, commitment, and spiritual strength from Him.</p>
<p>Let me assure you something: <strong>if in the midst of the most chaotic circumstances, you can remember that you</strong> have been called by God,&rdquo; you will regain your sense of significance and your will be re-energize! I know it without a doubt! That&rsquo;s what pulled me our of the biggest, most horrible mess of my life.</p>
<p>Let it sink for a minute: <strong>You, yes, you&hellip; You have been called by God to live for Him, with Him, and in behalf of Him in this life!</strong></p>
<p>How you face your tests and tribulations will reveal your sense of significance. Do you remember, <strong>&ldquo;you have been called by God?&rdquo;</strong> This is an important question, because you never know when your life will end. You never know if you will have a chance to &ldquo;succeed&rdquo; at what you set your mind to accomplish. But you can always be certain you are fulfilling your call by God. We are here on this earth, to bring glory to God—to show how to love again, and again&hellip; nothing more, nothing less. The purpose of our lives is to learn how to love. To show others how to love. (Matthew 22: 37-40). The heart of significance is to be able to catch the fact that <strong>God has called you to fulfill your purpose, this bringing glory to Him.</strong></p>
<p>The only reason why you are here on earth is to learn how to be loved and love again. <strong>SIN</strong> by Lucifer, Adam and Eve was a relational challenge to the very existential nature of God. You don&rsquo;t fight <strong>SIN,</strong> you let God love you; you learn to love again! <strong>SIN is simply the absence of love.</strong></p>
