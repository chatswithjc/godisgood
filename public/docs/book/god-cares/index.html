				<p><strong>GOD CARES! GOD LOVES YOU! GOD WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED!</strong> All of our teachings, studies, conversations are rooted in that one single principle. That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t believe in <strong>RELIGION.</strong> We believe that a <strong>RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD</strong> will make you understand how much God loves you! Once you get that in your brain, the rest is easy stuff! Religion and denominations make it complicated, God wants you and I to understand the basics!</p>
<p>John 3: 16, 17 are words said by Jesus echoing God&rsquo;s heartbeat for you and me!</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For God so LOVED the world that he GAVE his one and only Son, that WHOEVER believes in him SHALL NOT PERISH but have eternal life. For GOD DID NOT SEND HIS SON INTO THE WORLD TO CONDEMN THE WORLD, BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD through him.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This passage contains the fundamental truth you need to understand and accept if anything else will make sense. God loves you, and He wants <strong>YOU</strong> to be in His family! That&rsquo;s it! Once you catch a glimpse of His love the rest follows! Once you understand how passionate God feels about you, that love will drive you to do what is best for yourself! You will want to obey Him&hellip; Spend time with Him&hellip; Tell others about Him&hellip; Nothing will be too much! Love is the most powerful driving force in the universe!</p>
<p>It is not too big, nor is it too small and insignificant for God. He cares! Kind David wrote, <strong>&ldquo;Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer. From the end of the earth I will cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I&rdquo;</strong> (Psalm 61:1–2).</p>
<p>God is exactly what God meant to be to humans: &ldquo;Immanuel.&rdquo; (God with us) A God in the here and now. A relational God!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo; (God with us) is not about victory and glory, first. &ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo; (God with us) is about PRESENCE first.</p>
<p>The best portrayal of God&rsquo;s presence among humans happens between the humble birth of God as a baby and Friday on the cross (God with us).</p>
<p>The vast distance between the human and the divine is brought together by the wholeness of a God who became incarnated in human flesh and innocently become subject to everything that human beings are subject to—including suffering and death. God reflects the archetype of the human experience: INNOCENT SUFFERING.</p>
<p>John 3: 16-17 are words said by Jesus echoing God’s heartbeat for you and me!</p>
<p>“For God so LOVED the world that he GAVE his one and only Son, that WHOEVER believes in him SHALL NOT PERISH but have eternal life. For GOD DID NOT SEND HIS SON INTO THE WORLD TO CONDEMN THE WORLD, BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD through him.&quot;</p>
<p>This passage contains the fundamental truth you need to understand and accept if anything else will make sense. God loves you, and He wants YOU to be in His family! That’s it! Once you catch a glimpse of His love the rest follows! Once you understand how passionate God feels about you, that love will drive you to do what is best for yourself! You will want to obey Him… Spend time with Him… Tell others about Him… Nothing will be too much! Love is the most powerful driving force in the universe!</p>
<p>Do you know God’s love has a purpose?</p>
<p>“Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that GOD’S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?&quot; Romans 2:4 (NIV)</p>
<p>The word “repentance” in the English language does not reflect the true meaning of the word in the original Greek. “Repentance” has its root it the Old Latin which translated the Greek (&ldquo;metanoia&rdquo;) as “paenitentia” which came to mean penance or acts of penance that had to be done if one hoped to obtain grace. By extension it became sorrow, contrition, a penitent attitude.</p>
<p>The original word in the Greek “metanoia” is a word loaded with dynamic action. It simply means to “change one’s mind and perception of whatever preceded the act of “metanoia” or ‘repentance” It means you were going in one direction and the sparkle of God’s Spirit enlightened you, and you suddenly saw you are wrong, and changed! You see how offensive your action, disposition and behavior is to God!</p>
<p>God’s kindness is intended to lead you to want to CHANGE!</p>
<p>Everything God does for you has that purpose! To lead you to that moment, or moments of “metanoia.” (Repentance) To lead you into a state of mind and heart that says, “Wow, how could I not change for such a LOVER!” Doesn’t that ring to you like the best motivation for change ever?</p>
<p>His love, His kindness, His compassion, His goodness is meant to create in you the desire to change into His likeness! His goodness is to make us generous and compassionate toward others the way He is towards you!</p>
<p>If the goodness of God does not melt your heart, and you choose not to change out of pride and selfishness, NOTHING else will do it. If love does not melt your heart, punishment will not do it either! It will make you bitter. If goodness and love do not drive you to love others, a hard life won’t do it either! I have watched people going down into the darkness of their own selfishness, drowning in toxicity, with negative feelings and emotions, demon possessed, bitter against the world… and I have always thought the same… “Wow… They chose not to give in to the goodness of God! They chose to reject love!” That’s why I understand the concept of hell a little bit! There is no hope for someone who rejects love! Only a miserable life! There will be no room in heaven for people who have rejected love. It would be the most miserable existence ever! “Hell” is God’s last resort of grace, for people who reject love. Did you know that?</p>
<p>God’s goodness at all levels, and in all its manifestations has ONE SINGLE PURPOSE, Friend…</p>
<p>TO LEAD YOU TO CHANGE, AND BECOME THE LOVER GOD CREATED YOU TO BE, BEFORE SIN GOT HOLD OF YOU! To take you back to His original purpose… Love will always be the law of His universe!</p>
<p>Do you feel unworthy?</p>
<p>Do you feel that no matter how much people tell you, &ldquo;you are good,&rdquo; you still feel like you are not?</p>
<p>Do you struggle with being human? Has someone planted in your head the idea that the &ldquo;people of God&rdquo; don&rsquo;t commit more sin?</p>
<p>There are two reasons why people feel unworthy of God&rsquo;s love and His presence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Living a sinful life, apart from God, by choice. God is being rejected every day, every hour by choice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confusion about God&rsquo;s forgiveness and how He declares you perfect! Religion has made a mess of this! There are many views and doubts regarding this subject. The Bible taken in all its entirety makes it clear. Bible verses, picked to serve one view or other, create the mess religion feeds on!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectionism&rdquo; and &ldquo;reward for goodness&rdquo; are two strong strategies the devil uses to confuse followers of God! All the temptations and strategies the devil uses against people come under two categories, <strong>&ldquo;SEDUCTION&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;SUFFERING.&rdquo;</strong> &ldquo;Perfectionism&rdquo; and &ldquo;reward for goodness&rdquo; fall under seduction. Those two concepts are a delusion that causes enormous confusion when dealing with reality.</p>
<p>God promotes &ldquo;wholeness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wholeness&rdquo; is the opposite of &ldquo;slices&rdquo; like in a pie. Religion teaches &ldquo;pie Christianity.&rdquo; In other words, God is a slice of your entire life. The best quote born in the soil of such mindset is &ldquo;God helps those who help themselves.&rdquo; Many people believe this is a Bible verse! :-) Followers of God believe and promote &ldquo;wholeness.&rdquo; It means, God pronounces His followers perfect, good, holy, 100% acceptable to be citizens of the Kingdom of God! Under God&rsquo;s eyes, you are 100% when you accept Him in your life. There is no &ldquo;but&rdquo; or &ldquo;if&rdquo; kind of presupposition! God&rsquo;s declaration of perfection is absolute, complete and permanent. Are you with me, Friend?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Followers of God believe that <strong>God helps those who can not help themselves.</strong> The best candidates for the kingdom of God are people who are broken, hurting, dissatisfied, up against the wall, disillusioned, frustrated&hellip; people who have failed!</p>

<p>Once you accept your complete inability to please God with your &ldquo;human goodness&rdquo; or make Him hate you with you &ldquo;sinfulness,&rdquo; you surrender to God and He accepts you &ldquo;wholly&rdquo;. He declares you perfect! Your act of surrendering, though, is the beginning of perfection at your level of consciousness! You are aware of it now! God is not at a desk, checking a list while you wait in line to be forgiven! :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your new awareness of God&rsquo;s forgiveness is not an act God performs when you surrender to Him. That&rsquo;s where religion confuses people with &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after.&rdquo; Pray the &ldquo;sinners&rsquo; prayer&rdquo; otherwise you are going to hell, say some Christians! <strong>Once you surrender to God, God says, to you&hellip; &ldquo;Did you know that during all those years of rejection, you were already forgiven?&rdquo;</strong> That&rsquo;s what is so overwhelming about God&rsquo;s grace! All your sins from the past were forgiven 2.000 years ago on the cross of Calvary! And even 6.000 years ago before planet earth got into this horrible mess called SIN! God was not caught by surprise! God was not caught unprepared for the devil&rsquo;s presence! He knew and made provision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only that, all of your future sins have already been forgiven to the day you die. Tomorrow&rsquo;s sins? Forgiven! Next week&rsquo;s sins? Forgiven! Next year&rsquo;s sins? Forgiven! Everything is forgiven! <strong>Religious people get very uptight with my statement!</strong> But you see, Friend, lovers don&rsquo;t play games! If a follower of God sins intentionally against God&rsquo;s will, because he has been declared &ldquo;saved,&rdquo; he/she does not really understand the love of God! Authentic lovers don&rsquo;t play games with lovers! If a wife says to her husband, &ldquo;I will never leave you, divorce you, even if you do the worst thing you could ever imagine doing to me! Even if you betray me, get totally irritating, boring, unloving&hellip; I will not leave you! The only way you can get rid of me, is by leaving me, and going to a place where I can never find you.&rdquo; That love, that devotion, that loyalty is not be played with lightly! God is like that, Friend! God does not lose by giving you total assurance of forgiveness and perfection. You do, if you play games with God! The same in any human transaction. The giver never loses! Simply gets better!</p>

<p>If you are perplexed in your spiritual walk, I want to share with you a magnificent message today. It comes from Romans 3:21-31 (The Message). Read it, think about and ask God to engrave these words in the depths of your brain! Repeat it&hellip; Make it yours, until it finally becomes a part of you! [My comments]</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The God-setting-things-right that we read about has become Jesus-setting-things-right for us. And not only for us, but for everyone who believes in him. For there is no difference between us and them in this. Since we&rsquo;ve compiled this long and sorry record as sinners (both us and them) and PROVED THAT WE ARE UTTERLY INCAPABLE [Please notice the language, &ldquo;utterly incapable.&rdquo; It means that will power, habits, strategies, predisposition, good DNA, background, motivational strategies taught by gurus, religion&hellip; NOTHING! We are &ldquo;utterly incapable&rdquo;&hellip;] OF LIVING THE GLORIOUS LIVES GOD WILLS FOR US, GOD DID IT FOR US! Out of sheer generosity he put us in RIGHT STANDING with himself. A pure gift. He got us out of the mess we&rsquo;re in and restored us to where he always wanted us to be. And he did it by means of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God sacrificed Jesus on the altar of the world to clear that world of sin. Having faith in him sets us in the clear. God decided on this course of action in full view of the public—to set the world in the clear with himself through the sacrifice of Jesus, finally taking care of the sins he had so patiently endured. This is not only clear, but it&rsquo;s now—this is current history! God sets things right. HE ALSO MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO LIVE IN HIS RIGHTNESS.&rdquo;</strong> [The same power that set us right, is also transforming us every day into His likeness!]</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;So where does that leave our proud Jewish insider claims and counter-claims? Canceled? Yes, canceled. What we&rsquo;ve learned is this: GOD DOES NOT RESPOND TO WHAT WE DO; WE RESPOND TO WHAT GOD DOES! [Simply amazing!] We&rsquo;ve finally figured it out. Our lives get in step with GOD and ALL OTHERS BY LETTING HIM SET THE PACE, not by proudly or anxiously trying to run the parade.&rdquo;</strong> [Did you noticed? The presence of God in your life does not only set you right with Him, but with others also. Lying, falsehood, cheating, hypocrisy, using people for your own purposes&hellip; these are all manifestations that God is not running the show!]</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;BUT BY SHIFTING OUR FOCUS FROM WHAT WE DO TO WHAT GOD DOES, don&rsquo;t we cancel out all our careful keeping of the rules and ways God commanded? Not at all. What happens, in fact, is that by putting that entire way of life in its proper place, we confirm it.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Here is the one strategy that can totally revolutionize your spiritual life, today, Friend! I promise you&hellip; It will eliminate your perplexities, doubts about how good you are, if you are performing according to God&rsquo;s standards. <strong>SHIFT YOUR FOCUS FROM WHAT YOU DO, FROM WHAT PEOPLE DO, TO WHAT GOD HAS DONE, IS DOING, AND WILL DO ALL THE WAY TO THE END! God is the God of all people, all around the world!</strong></p>

<p>Unbelief, rejection, lack of spiritual passion for a relationship with God, blindness for the needs of people, break God’s heart, because He knows the consequences. But when the door of the human heart is shut, He refuses to enter forcibly. He will only knock, wanting to gain admittance. He has given us the ability to choose. But when we choose the wrong thing, He knows the repercussions that will follow—in this life and the one to come. And His heart is broken.</p>
<p>Would you recognize God if He would be in your midst? Would you welcome God’s personal visit to you? What if God would visit you in the person of a homeless person? Would you see Him? What if God would come to your church? Would He be allowed to preach? What if God would invite you to make a commitment to Him beyond anything you have ever done? What if God would invite you to have a daily time of devotion with Him? Reading the Bible, praying? Would you have the time for God?</p>
<p>What breaks the heart of God is REJECTION in all its manifestations. Lack of passion for lost people breaks the heart of God. It means you don’t understand how much He loves! Lack of passion for the hungry, the poor, the sick breaks the heart of God! You are His hands and feet on earth!</p>
<p>Will you accept God in your life today? Will you follow Him? Will you invite someone to join the family of God? Will you pray for lost people? Do you care? It’s all part of God’s invitation to LOVE RECKLESSLY.</p>
<h2 id="my-lonely-journey-with-god">My Lonely Journey with God <a href="#my-lonely-journey-with-god" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I am a seeker. I am committed to let God love me every day and seek God’s will in the reading of the Bible and the direction of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.&rdquo; (Proverbs 4:27, KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’&rdquo; (John 14:6)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matthew 7:13-14)</p>

<p><strong>THE LONELINESS OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD IS A NARROW ROAD</strong></p>
<p>So, I am not politicaly conservative. I don’t believe rules and fear make people authentically loving and compassionate. Conservatism preserves order, civility and protects people from anarchy, but in the end we must hear the voice from and shift from self-centered living to God/Christ/Cross/Gospel centered life.</p>
<p>I am not a religious person. I don’t believe in religion. I consider religion a human attempt to catch the reality of God from our side of the universe. The word “religion” (Latin: “religare” which means “bond” or “re-unite”) is a good word, but unfortunately it has become a symbol of the human attempt to seek, reject, or make sense of God.</p>
<p>Religion is in its very essence anthropomorphism (Transfer human views and perceptions on to God).</p>
<p>Religion is the desperate attempt to make sense of God from a human perspective. I don’t believe you can “theologize” God unless you experienced God in your consciousness. You can talk “about” God, your can practice religion like an addict, you can talk about God like you talk about the weather, or biology, or computer science.</p>
<p>I am not politicaly liberal. I don’t believe everything goes. I don’t believe the answers to the complex fabric of the human existence are liberal views. Liberalism is as extreme and unrealistic as conservatism is. One is obsessed with “preserving,” the other with “bringing walls down.”</p>
<p>I BELIEVE IN LETTING GOD LOVE ME, BECAUSE I BELIEVE LOVE IS A POWER THAT CAN TRANSFORM MY LIFE FROM THE INSIDE OUT. Love defines the existential reality and unlimited power of God. I BELIEVE THAT A “RELATIONSHIP” WITH GOD IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE, BUT VITAL TO A LIFE THAT NATURALLY MANIFESTS LOVE AND COMPASSION.</p>
<p>When you believe, repent and receive the Holy Spirt, you must let God LOVE you, God will not make you a Christian, God makes you born again for a heavenly country. God will turn you into a loving, growing mature son/daughter of Heaven.</p>
<p>When you let God LOVE you, you won’t need to try to be a good person. That’s not your job. You will spend time with God, and let God transform you naturally.</p>
<p>I have found out that a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD when I let God love me, is not about trying to overcome particular sinful behaviors, but a correction of what I believe God is like. This is a radical differentiation with the general spirit of religion.</p>
<p>The real PURPOSE behind letting God LOVE you, is to establish a RELATIONSHIP with God, that will grow your consciousness of God’s 24/7 presence in your life and TRANSFORM YOU! When you finally understand that God loves you matter what… When it dawns on you that God is with you no matter what… you will begin to wake up to the reality of a God no religion can teach you about!</p>
<p>“So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: TAKE YOUR EVERYDAY, ORDINARY LIFE—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—(Yes, your exhausted self, your defeated feelings, your sense of despair, your multiple challenges, all of it) AND PLACE IT BEFORE GOD AS AN OFFERING.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A love relationship with God will heal you by changing your beliefs about God and transforming you into who you are meant to be. Meaning and purpose are embedded in this concept of becoming.</p>
<p>When you let God love you first, you suddenly realize you are part of a history that spans all through human history.</p>
<p>You become part of the body of God eternally connected with a huge, worldwide, global, historical, and timeless crowd of believers.</p>
<p>You begin to read the stories of the Biblical narratives and you suddenly identify with King David who lived and wrote many of the Psalms almost 3.000 years ago. You identify with Abraham who lied twice letting other men take his gorgeous wife to protect himself from being killed. Yet God chose him for a special mission.</p>
<p>You read in the Gospels about rough fishermen who became followers of God as Jesus. You read about a religion that hated his guts, while humble, broken people came to him to be healed and be comforted by him.</p>
<p>You were there 2.000 years ago. Those human beings were not much different than you and I. The words of Jesus begin to speak to you.</p>
<p>As your relationship with God matures, God stirs your heart for other people. As you connect with God, you find your heart going out like never before to people around in your sphere of action. Your relationship with God fuels and creates a longing for a relationship with your spouse, your neighbors, your kids.</p>
<p>Your relationship with God ignites in you a desire to connect and relate to others. The mark of God in your life becomes love, compassion, grace towards people who suffer and are needy.</p>
<p>Yet as you go deeper in your personal relationship with God you begin to find another reality Pastors, megachurches, religion and Christian friends don’t tell you about because they have seldom experienced it.</p>
<p>Suddenly God becomes the center of attention in your life. Your consciousness of God grows, deepens, and expands.</p>
<p>You realize God is with you all the time whether you are aware of it or not. You also realize God loves you no matter what you do. This shocks most people because they have been told by religion that God only likes “nice” people, and those who only do what God wants them to do.</p>
<p>Your consciousness of God’s love drives you to begin to practice a lifestyle of reckless and radical abandonment, by making God your sole desire and highest delight in life.</p>
<p>You find yourself conversing with God before going to sleep, or when you wake up in the morning. Or you decide to turn your radio off when you drive to chat with God.</p>
<p>You find yourself longing for intimacy with God.</p>
<p>This is what I have chosen to call in my own experience the “costly” side of my relationship with God. That’s when you begin to experience the attacks of demonic forces. You also experience antagonism from religious people.</p>
<p>This side of the relationship with God is costly because the crowd is not with you. Perhaps you know one or two people who share the same passion with you.</p>
<p>You find yourself struggling with the superficiality of religion in sermon, articles, books and social media.</p>
<p>Intimacy with God is costly. Here is the beauty of it.</p>
<p>The more you let God love you, the more you will experience love, and the more reckless and radical you will become in your response to people who feel antagonistic against you.</p>
<p>The more you let God love you the more naturally changes will happen in your life. Why? Because a walk with God is not about “trying” to be good and change, but letting God change you.</p>
<p>The more you catch a glimpse of the love of God, the more you will be attracted to broken people. The less you will be affected adversely by people who find you weird, too passionate about God, and compassionate about the needy.</p>
<p>I get a glimpse now of the spiritual loneliness and frustration Job experienced away from the church gathering, and the popularity of religious power. Wow… For all practical purposes he was perceived as a religious fiasco, a loser, a lost man.</p>
<p>Job was harassed by the leadership of God’s true church at the time. Job struggled, agonized, and did not surrendered to orthodox, conservative theology. He stood rooted in a personal knowledge of God.</p>
<p>When Job’s religious, conservative wife saw her husband suffering she said, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? (Your belief in your kind of God) Curse “God” and die!&quot; (Job 2:9 - NIV)</p>
<p>The real dark loneliness of Job’s journey was caused by a clash between the lies of conservative religion about God, and his own experiential knowledge of God.</p>
<p>In response to Pastors who attempted to dissuade him with conservative theology, his own personal, emotional, mental, and physical agony, the loneliness he must have experienced, Job stood up and said,</p>
<p>“So hold your tongue while I have my say, then I’ll take whatever I have coming to me. Why do I go out on a limb like this and take my life in my hands? (Why do I risk my own existence? Why do I put my own life on the line by standing against your conservative theology AND YOUR LIES ABOUT GOD?)&quot;</p>
<p>And here comes Job’s stunning answer…</p>
<p>“BECAUSE (I know God so well) that EVEN IF HE KILLED ME, I’D KEEP ON HOPING. I’d defend my innocence (against your accusations based on lies about the character of God) to the very end. Just wait, this is going to work out for the best—my salvation!&quot;(Job 13:15 - The Message)</p>
<p>Job’s experience gets to the core of what I am describing as spiritual loneliness in a journey with God while surrounded by people who don’t comprehend your path, unless they are or have been there.</p>
<p>What Job did not know, because he was not privy to the information we can read in the book today, is that the conservative theologians who confronted Job day and day out, were part of a demonic strategy to destroy Job. Job was a test case for the whole universe to see. God knew about it. God allowed the test case to take place to prove that love wins over pain, suffering and fear. Of course, Job and the conservative religious Pastors did not know what was behind.</p>
<p>It’s simply a fascinating story when put in the context of today’s contemporary religious landscape.</p>
<p>I understand Abraham’s broken human nature, manipulative behavior, allowing men to take his gorgeous wife twice to protect his own life. He became very wealthy because he lied, and the King bestowed fortune on him, driven by fear of punishment by the “gods.” What would you say of that kind of wealth created by someone today?</p>
<p>in spite of it, God saw in Abraham a struggling sinner with a mission, a purpose. Abraham’s lack of faith in God’s promise, like many of us, drove him to “help” God, which created a mess we are still dealing with as a global community, 4.000 years later. It just blows your mind!</p>
<p>I thank God every day for the Biblical narratives that shed light on the human fabric, how broken it is, how fragile, how twisted, and then on the other side of the spectrum glimpses of the character of God.</p>
<p>I understand the loneliness of King David, as a fallen sinner in the presence of God. Persecuted day and day out by his enemies, and his own family. Suffering the consequences of his own fall, David surrendered in the presence of God and saw the face of God’s grace, mercy and redemptive power.</p>
<p>David did not find affirmation in the Jewish religion of the time, but in a personal relationship with God. Yes, God used a prophet to get his attention, but the spiritual journey was David’s and David’s alone.</p>
<p>I read the Psalms and I find in them a guy who was intimately connected to God. A struggling sinner hanging on to God. His hymns, poems, and utterances about God were born in a deep empirical consciousness of God’s presence you don’t learn by reasoning, or simply theologizing God. It’s knowledge rooted in a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>YOU WILL FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXISTENTIAL LONELINESS IN THEIR JOURNEY WITH GOD</strong></p>
<p>There is a depth of fellowship only available between like-minded (or rather: like-spirited) souls that share the same depth in their relationship with God. They have experience the same intensity and passion for God. They have “seen” with the eyes of faith the same treasures, and “tasted” the same pleasures of heaven.</p>
<p>These are people who may looked ruined socially, economically, but they are rich spiritually. Their hearts are fixed on the same thing and they share the same commitments.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, many of these people are homeless, some of them are struggling with mental disturbances, they are suffering, they carry the scars of painful memories of the past, abandonment, and abuse. They know a God I know, and we can talk about the same God!</p>
<p>And let me add that the people I meet and connect because we know the same God, are not religious conservatives. They are not denominational loyalists. They don’t push organized religion as the “way” into the Kingdom of God. They are not social liberals. They are not obsessed with social justice, for the sake of activism, THOUGHT they stand for love and compassion (as God does, above legalism, right and wrong) as the core of God’s call in their lives… They are the modern “JOBs” experiencing a personal relationship with God which I call mystical, real, profoundly satisfying, and manifested in a life of humble service and compassion for others.</p>
<p>They may be suffering, they may not be successful in the eyes of the culture but we know the same God.</p>
<p>This is the narrow road. This is a lonely journey!</p>
<p>Very often in this kind of walk with God you truly feel like a peg in a square hole. A misfit. You get fingers pointing at you from all directions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You, GOD, are MY GOD, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.&quot; (Psalm 63:1 - NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GOD’S PEOPLE ARE NOT GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD. OFTEN IN THE MIDST OF A LONELY JOURNEY LIKE YOU</p>
<p>I have to think of all these believers in the spiritual outbacks of this world. Those who cultivate lovesick hearts and an ever growing hunger for the presence and the knowledge of God where no one else does.</p>
<p>People in nations or regions that die from spiritual hunger without realizing, people who belong to the few who cultivate the secret place of intimacy and wholeheartedness before God without having any support from the people around them or any people around them who inspire them to give even more and go even deeper.</p>
<p>I have to think of the people who, after having been touched by God in a mighty way, return to their traditional, conservative, lukewarm churches where no one has a paradigm for what they have experienced.</p>
<p>I have to think of the missionary couple who moved to a spiritually desolate region, completely stripped of any spiritual fellowship apart from each other to serve the needy.</p>
<p>I have to think of the young man who encountered God in the most weird kind of experience (he told me he felt weird) and due to a lack of other Christians in his area started reading Matthew 5, 6, the words of Jesus on his own while his atheist parents scolded him for his insanity and religious fanaticism. He ended up joining a Buddhist community and his spiritual experience and connection with God put me to shame.</p>
<p>I have to think of the group of people who consistently come together and experienced the most intense prayer meetings, with crying and sobbing in, and because of the measure of the presence of God in their prayer meetings, they ventured to help people no one in the entire city understood, but they were compelled to do it by the love of God.</p>
<p>These are the modern day hermits.</p>
<p>People who - while living in cities, surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people, even while being part of communities of believers or secular people - find themselves in a spiritual desert of loneliness.</p>
<p>These are the spiritual hermits who understand the words of David and cry with the same longing and commitment:</p>
<p>SOON OR LATER YOU AND I WILL BE FACED WITH GOD’S CALL TO LEAVE EVERYTHING BEHIND, LET GOD LOVE US, AND FOLLOW GOD IN THE WORLD. IT’S ALL ABOUT LOVE!</p>
<p>Love calls you and me to press on, to go deeper in in our relationship with God, to get to know God more as we journey together.</p>
<p>Once you have experienced the love of God, you will be emboldened like Job was.</p>
<p>You can’t go back, you can’t just stay where you are. You burned the theological bridges and the lies who kept you imprisoned in fear and legalism.</p>
<p>To the one who has tasted of God’s liberating grace backing down is an act of highest stupidity anyone is capable of. You are ruined for ever if you choose to reject such love. God does not stop loving you. You become miserable running away from God!</p>
<p>Love’s longing is to give everything, surrender all, leave everything behind to cling to God, just as a lover embraces a lover in real life. “Counting the cost” (Luke 14:27-28 - NIV) makes sense in a capitalistic culture, but really… that religious approach to a relationship with God was “yesterday,” when you did not know better. “Calculating the cost” of a relationship with God is an absolutely absurd idea to the one consumed with yearning for the God who loves you beyond your wildest imagination!</p>
