				<p>Religion teaches you that you have to do a bunch of things to reach perfection in the eyes of God. Nothing could ever be further from the truth of God! You are born forgiven, though imperfect. If you believe and walk on the state of perfection God has declared for you, you will die forgiven, though imperfect. You are perfect by God&rsquo;s <strong>TOTAL,</strong> complete forgiveness, though you will always remain imperfect as a human being! The opposite of what I am describing here is <strong>PERFECTIONISM.</strong> Perfectionism is a constant striving towards being better and better (morality) in order to gain the acceptance of God, and also earn reward or points towards a better looking mansion in heaven! Wow! Everything in our culture strive to teach you that you earn status by adopting rules and standards. Consequences is what corrects behavior, mostly. God, instead, begins with love, forgiveness and freedom!</p>
<p>Here is the reality, friend, unless you read the simple story of God from the Bible, unless you let God love you <strong>FIRST,</strong> and believe every single hour and day that you <strong>ARE</strong> perfect in the eyes of God, you will be confused by what religion will tell you! Religion will tell you that you are <strong>PERFECT</strong> if&hellip; if&hellip; if&hellip; God says, <strong>&ldquo;YOU ARE! GO INTO THE WORLD AND LIVE IT OUT!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to walk on the perfection God gave you, you <strong>don&rsquo;t need to try to be better,</strong> you simply need to surrender to the power of the God who is with you all the time (The Holy Spirit). The improvements and changes of your life you get by effort and sacrifice <strong>DO NOT IMPRESS GOD</strong> at all! They don&rsquo;t matter. What matters is your humble surrender to the transforming power of God. And that is the fundamental difference between <strong>RELIGION</strong> and a <strong>RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our love for others is our grateful response to the love God first demonstrated to us. <em>(1 John 4:19, TPT)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>God loves you, He created you good, like everything else in creation</li>
<li>There is only one unique person like you in all of creation</li>
<li>God longs to live inside of you. He is waiting for you to say Yes to Him!</li>
<li>So believe in God, let God love you, love yourself and others</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grace">GRACE <a href="#grace" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Nothing is more explosive in the Bible than the concept grace. This is the bottom line that separates all RELIGIONS (Including the Christian religion) from those WHO have a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. RELIGION is the attempt to help God, to reach out to HIM. A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD starts with God, it follows that you surrender to His love, and God finishes the world of perfecting you. In GRACE, who believe in a 100%, undiluted, raw GRACE rooted RELATIONSHIP with God.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What actually took place is this: I TRIED keeping rules and working my head off to please God, and it didn&rsquo;t work. So I quit being a &ldquo;law man&rdquo; so that I could be God&rsquo;s man. Christ&rsquo;s life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I appear righteous before you or have your good opinion, and I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me. The life you see me living is not &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I am not going to go back on that.&quot;</strong> <em>(Galatians 2:20-21)</em></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Is it not clear to you that to go back to that old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion would be an abandonment of everything personal and free in my relationship with God? I refuse to do that, to repudiate God&rsquo;s grace. If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily.&quot;</strong> Powerful words of Jesus!</p>
<p>One of the marks of a follower of God is simplicity. Simplicity in our culture tends to have negative connotations. When we speak of someone who is &ldquo;simple&rdquo; we don&rsquo;t necessarily mean it as a virtue. But in the Bible <strong>simplicity</strong> is the basic quality of those who will live with God throughout eternity. Did you know that? Here are the words of Jesus&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For an answer Jesus called over a child, whom he stood in the middle of the room, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, once and for all, that unless you return to square one and start over like children, you&rsquo;re not even going to get a look at the kingdom, let alone get in. Whoever becomes SIMPLE and ELEMENTAL again, like this child, will rank high in God&rsquo;s kingdom. What&rsquo;s more, when you receive the childlike on my account, it&rsquo;s the same as receiving me.&quot;</strong> <em>(Matthew 18:2-5)</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;God is simple&hellip; stop complicating your life with religion and personal anxiety&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Matthew 6 you will catch a glimpse of God&rsquo;s view that states that the &ldquo;flow,&rdquo; enjoying the now, being free from worry and anxiety is the way to experience God&rsquo;s best for you. On the other side &ldquo;religion, and trying to be and do&rdquo; is the best way to lose sight of God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Matthew 6 introduces you into God&rsquo;s wholeness, God&rsquo;s simplicity and begs you to walk into it and let yourself be. Read it slowly and you will get the idea Jesus is trying to convey.</p>
<p>“Be especially careful when you are trying to be good so that you don’t make a performance out of it. It might be good theater, but the God who made you won’t be applauding.&rdquo; <em>(Matthew 6)</em></p>
<p>“When you do something for someone else, don’t call attention to yourself. You’ve seen them in action, I’m sure—‘playactors’ I call them—treating prayer meeting and street corner alike as a stage, acting compassionate as long as someone is watching, playing to the crowds. They get applause, true, but that’s all they get. When you help someone out, don’t think about how it looks. Just do it—quietly and unobtrusively. THAT IS THE WAY YOUR GOD, WHO CONCEIVED YOU IN LOVE, WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES, HELPS YOU OUT.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Summing it all up, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;ll do best by filling your minds and meditating on things true, noble, reputable, authentic, compelling, GRACIOUS—the BEST, not the worst; the BEAUTIFUL, not the ugly; things to PRAISE, not things to curse. Put into practice what you learned from me, what you heard and saw and realized. Do that, and God, who makes everything work together, will work you into his most excellent harmonies.&quot;</strong> What you just read is in the Bible. God is into the beauty of simplicity. <em>(Philippians 4:8)</em></p>
<p>Simplicity in its true meaning, and out of the frame of the four misconceptions I listed above, can be a powerful voice for God. Children are simple. The most passionate love is simple. Authentic emotions are simple, as opposed to neurotic and twisted manifestations of denial.</p>

  <summary>How to Be Happy</summary>
  <h2 id="how-to-be-happy">How to Be Happy</h2>
<p>You can always choose to be happy, but you must choose yourself to be happy on God&rsquo;s terms!</p>
<p>Psalm 119:1-8 contains <strong>THE SECRET TO BE BLESSED BY GOD.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re blessed when you stay on course, walking steadily on the road revealed by God.
You&rsquo;re blessed when you follow his directions, doing your best to find him.
That&rsquo;s right—you don&rsquo;t go off on your own; you walk straight along the road he set.
You, God, PRESCRIBED THE RIGHT WAY TO LIVE; now you expect us to live it.
Oh, that my steps might be steady, keeping to the course you set;
Then I&rsquo;d never have any regrets in comparing my life with your counsel.
I thank you for speaking straight from your heart; I learn the pattern of your righteous ways.
I&rsquo;m going to do what you tell me to do; don&rsquo;t ever walk off and leave me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses describe exactly the opposite of what religion is all about. If you read the words of King David carefully, you will find out the he is talking about obedience here. But his description of obedience is <strong>RELATIONAL.</strong> Obedience is the result of a relationship with God, that is so precious to you, that you long to walk with Him, you long to learn His way!</p>
<p><strong>God prescribes the right way to live.</strong> That is the fundamental truth of the Bible. If you want to obtain the best of life, learn God&rsquo;s way and respond to His invitation. Don&rsquo;t seek to fulfill your life with anything else but the will and the presence of God!</p>
<p>God will not only share with you the best life to live ever on this earth, but will also enable you, with transforming power, to become what He has set you to be in fulfilling your purpose.</p>

  <summary>How to Live Your Best Life</summary>
  <h2 id="how-to-live-your-best-life">How to Live Your Best Life</h2>
<p>We are born to dream. We are born to fly high with ideas. We are born to be creative. I love watching kids play. We are made by God to dream big dreams, and think of the best life has to offer. The human imagination has no limit. God is not against you <strong>LIVING YOUR BEST LIFE EVER.</strong> All to the contrary, He wants to do the opposite of what the world does&hellip; The world and the culture bring you down, help you to get stuck in a rut, makes you materialistic and dependent on &ldquo;things.&rdquo; We, human, tend to decide what is best for us, we obsess over those things, we abhor what we label as unpleasant, and then miss the magnificent opportunities God has for us!</p>
<p>Romans 12:1-2 says</p>
<p><strong>So here&rsquo;s what I want you to do, God helping you:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) TAKE YOUR EVERYDAY, ORDINARY LIFE—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—</strong></p>
<p>[Think of all the basics of your life&hellip; a roof over your head&hellip; a job&hellip; family&hellip; friends&hellip; opportunities&hellip; school&hellip; career&hellip;]</p>
<p><strong>2) and place it before God as an offering.</strong></p>
<p>[Bring everything to God as an offering&hellip; the ability to sleep, walk, work, going to the gym, exercising, eating, going to see a doctor&hellip; money to pay bills&hellip;. Presenting everything to God as an offering reminds you who is in control of your life&hellip;]</p>
<p><strong>3) Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him.</strong></p>
<p>[Imagine this incredible principle&hellip; <strong>THE BEST YOU CAN DO FOR GOD, IS TO EMBRACE WHAT HE GIVES YOU&hellip; WHAT HE ALLOWS YOU TO RECEIVE AND HAVE&hellip;</strong> This may include experiences you are not too hot about&hellip; this may include pieces of this fragmented world&hellip; all part of your ordinary life&hellip; Paul says, <strong>EMBRACE IT!</strong> You will bring a smile to God&rsquo;s face when you embrace everything, because, again&hellip; you are focusing on God as the source of your fulfillment in life&hellip;]</p>
<p>[The rest is of this passage is what the apostle Paul says to re-shape the principle he share in the first verse]</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking.</strong></p>
<p>[Living life on your own, trying to do your best, without God, is always a missed opportunity to <strong>LIVE LIFE AT YOUR BEST! One sign of God&rsquo;s absence in your life is a boring routine with nothing to be grateful and joyful about&hellip;Life is like a treadmill&hellip;</strong> ]</p>
<p><strong>Instead, fix your attention on God. You&rsquo;ll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, GOD BRINGS THE BEST OUT OF YOU, develops well-formed maturity in you.</strong></p>
<p>I am far from perfect, humanly speaking! So far, is not even funny!</p>
<p>But I will tell you what I am excited about&hellip; I am catching on to the work God is doing in my life! I am fascinated by what He does when I stop fighting! He is phenomenal! The more I embrace every moment the better it gets&hellip;</p>
<p>So, I am passing on to you, not just a piece of life coaching advice&hellip; I am sharing with you what God is doing in my life, as I follow this simple 3 step principle!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take everything life brings to you&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer it to God&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then embrace everything&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the reason&hellip; Unless you offer God everything you won&rsquo;t be able to embrace everything&hellip; In our human nature we only want to embrace what we label &ldquo;good&rdquo;&hellip;. God says, &ldquo;Offer everything&hellip; then embrace it&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;What do I do with my lack of money? Shortage of funds&hellip; &quot; Offer it to God, present it to him as an offering, then you will be able to embrace your condition and learn incredible lessons to grow and see new possibilities.</p>
</details>
<hr>
<p>Whatever you are facing, good and bad, offer it to God and then embrace it, I promise you will see God opening your eyes and producing magnificent spiritual, emotional and mental growth, that will impact your body, relationships and your world around.</p>
