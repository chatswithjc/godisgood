<p>Even though Jesus Christ is equal to God, he never spoke of Himself while on earth, but always spoke what He heard from His Heavenly Father. He was never selfish, but always God-centered.</p>
<p>“And being found in appearance as a man, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.&quot;&ndash;Philippians 2:8</p>
<p>A peek into an experience Jesus had tells a lot about His humble and obedient disposition. He was starving to death during His temptation in the wilderness. The devil tempted Him. He would not turn a rock into bread after the devil suggested that He should. He answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God’ &quot; (Luke 4:4).</p>
<p>Jesus was always thinking of others. He was humble! ALL LOVE. So what does it say about Him when He uttered the words from the cross, “I thirst” (John 19:28)? This was the Creator of the universe saying, “I thirst.” Do you think Jesus could have solved His own problem? Do you think He could have spoken water into existence? Yes. Jesus could have had Niagara Falls appear before Him if He so desired. But instead He said, “I thirst.”</p>
<p>This reminds us that although Jesus Christ was fully God, He also was fully man. Never for a moment did He give up His Divinity, though He did not displayed it in His miraculous events at will. He shrouded His glory. He was still always God. But the miracles He performed He promised you and I could perform also. He showed us the way. He led the way for you and me. (John 14:12) That is why His death, His voluntary death, and His death alone, was sufficient to meet the righteous demands of the Father. Amazing!</p>
<p>Take a moment today to thank God for becoming “Emmanuel,” God with us. He came to us, that we may know His supreme love. That we may follow Him, like He followed His Heavenly Father, even though, He was God! That His love may compels us to obey God, as Jesus obeyed God, even though He was still God!</p>
<p>If you want to start a relationship with Jesus Christ, or have fallen away and want to rededicate your life to Christ. Simply come to Him humbly by faith, confessing your sin and need of a Savior. Each person must sort out what to say to Jesus for himself, but one might try praying something like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus, I&rsquo;m so sorry that I have been going my own way and not Your way. But I thank You so much for loving me enough to come and die for my sins. And now I&rsquo;m so happy that in resurrecting you are alive and well, and I want to know You. Please come into my life, change my heart and mind, and let me know you deeply. I recognize You as King, please teach me how to obey and love You.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And being found in appearance as a man, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.&rdquo;</strong>--Philippians 2:8</p>
<p>More and more I wonder how would Jesus look and behave in our contemporary culture. You know why I wonder? Because the people of His time went crazy with His humble demeanor. Read the Gospels. They thought He was a fraud! He did not match the hero they had come to expect of their prophesied and idolized image of the Messiah! They liked His power manifested in miracles and healing, but they did not know what to do with his humbleness. Judah would have loved to see Jesus manifesting His power. He would have been Jesus&rsquo; campaign manager! Peter would have loved nothing less. The entire nation of Israel would have felt that their destiny had finally been fulfilled! Imagine!</p>
<p>If you were Jesus (God), would you ever be tempted to do a miracle for yourself? I probably would. If I had been Jesus, instead of walking long distances, I would have just said, &ldquo;I am now going to be there,&rdquo; and there I would be.</p>
<p>A peek into an experience Jesus had tells a lot about His humble and obedient disposition. He was starving to death during His temptation in the wilderness. The devil tempted Him. He would not turn a rock into bread after the devil suggested that He should. He answered, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God&rsquo; &quot; (Luke 4:4).</p>
<p><strong>Jesus was always thinking of others.</strong> He was humble! <strong>ALL LOVE.</strong> So what does it say about Him when He uttered the words from the cross, &ldquo;I thirst&rdquo; (John 19:28)? This was the Creator of the universe saying, &ldquo;I thirst.&rdquo; Do you think Jesus could have solved His own problem? Do you think He could have spoken water into existence? Yes.

(John 14:12) That is why His death, His voluntary death, and His death alone, was sufficient to meet the righteous demands of the Father. Amazing!</p>
<p>Do you catch a glimpse of the humble Jesus? Would he feel comfortable in our mega-churches? Would He feel comfortable with religion? Would He attend our large institutional churches? Where would you find Him? Would He be allowed to preach from the pulpits that proclaim to be the authentic church of God on earth? Where would you find Jesus? With what kind of people would He chose to spend time with? Would you consider Him a lesser Jesus because He would offer to sleep in your couch at your apartment? Would you expect Him to own His own airplane, stay in resorts, expensive hotels? Think about humble Jesus for a minute!</p>

<p>Start by knowing God&rsquo;s written word. There is so much extensive wisdom and knowledge about God, about human nature, and about God&rsquo;s dealings with mankind and vice-versa. Take some time to learn how to study the Bible, and then do it, study it.</p>
<p>By having God&rsquo;s spirit within you. Jesus started his ministry off by being baptized and the Holy Spirit came upon him. We human beings are all spiritual creatures; we have a body and we have a soul, but our spirit, our essence, is what will live on forever. Without God&rsquo;s spirit living within us, we are dead, we cannot live. God&rsquo;s spirit is what teaches us His will, He is what gives us joy in difficult times, and God&rsquo;s spirit is the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead! The very notion of being &ldquo;saved&rdquo;, or being given eternal life, is identified by being reconciled with God, which ultimately means having God&rsquo;s spirit. By having God&rsquo;s spirit, we become a new creature, we are born again.</p>
<p>By understanding the intentions of Jesus through understanding His actions and His words. Jesus said and did many things, but he did none of it haphazardly, everything Jesus said or did was deliberate and profoundly intentional in the part it played or would play in the eternal scope of the whole universe. You cannot imitate Jesus if you have no idea what his objectives were. So study His words and His intentions carefully.</p>
<p>By doing everything that Jesus instructed his disciples to do. If you don&rsquo;t know what those things are, you&rsquo;re going to need to study. But we can always revert back again to the same fundamental principle, that Jesus said that all the law and prophets rest on two key commandments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Love God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. And,</li>
<li>Love your neighbor as yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>But Jesus empowered his disciples through the Holy Spirit to lay hands on the sick and heal them, to cast out demons, and more. They were expected to do these things in love. It’s all always about love. Remember this, because it was reemphasized later in the New Testament especially by Paul, that nothing we do is meaningful or of any value without love.</p>
<p>If I have the gift of prophecy
and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
and if I have a faith that can move mountains,
but do not have love, I am nothing.
(1 Corinthians 13:12)</p>
