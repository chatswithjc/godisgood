<p><strong>&ldquo;Suppose one of you had a hundred sheep and lost one. Wouldn&rsquo;t you leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until you found it? When found, you can be sure you would put it across your shoulders, rejoicing, and when you got home call in your friends and neighbors, saying, &lsquo;Celebrate with me! I&rsquo;ve found my lost sheep!&rsquo; Count on it—THERE&rsquo;S MORE JOY IN HEAVEN OVER ONE SINNER&rsquo;S RESCUED LIFE THAN OVER NINETY-NINE GOOD PEOPLE IN NO NEED OF RESCUE.&rdquo;</strong> Luke 15:7 - The Message</p>
<p>Now&hellip; Who are the <strong>&ldquo;good people in no need of rescue&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes people wonder whether those in heaven or in other planets, know what is taking place on earth. Some would say no. But I beg to differ. I think heaven and God&rsquo;s creatures in other planets that have not sinned are aware of what is happening on earth.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t think our loved ones are sitting in heaven, watching everything we do. But I do believe the angels and inhabitants of &ldquo;unfallen&rdquo; planets know what is going on, and there are verses that I could cite to prove that point. (Revelation 5: 13, 14) <strong>But this much I know CLEARLY: When someone surrenders to God and they repent of their sinful condition, there is REJOICING in heaven. Whenever there is a CONVERSION on earth, there is PARTYING in heaven. That, I know without a doubt!</strong></p>
<p>God gets excited when <strong>LOST PEOPLE</strong> accept Him and repent of their <strong>LIFE WITHOUT GOD,</strong> and so should we. As C. S. Lewis said, <strong>Joy is the serious business of heaven.</strong> So if they are having a party in heaven over the conversion of one person, should we, too, not be excited when we see someone come to Christ?</p>
<p>I believe that is what kept Jesus going, even to the cross, when He was on this earth! Hebrews 12:2 tells us that Jesus, &ldquo;for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; What was that joy? It was us. We were the joy. We were the prize. We were the treasure. We were the goal He went after and laid it all down for.</p>
<p>I want to leave a thought with you&hellip;</p>
<p>Could it be that we find it difficult to rejoice over a <strong>lost person</strong> coming to God because we really don&rsquo;t know what it means to be <strong>lost</strong>? Could it be that religion and culture have confused us so badly that we don&rsquo;t understand that <strong>&ldquo;NICE&rdquo;</strong> people, <strong>&ldquo;MORAL&rdquo;</strong> people, <strong>&ldquo;COMMANDMENTS OBEYING&rdquo;</strong> people,<strong>&ldquo;HELPFUL&rdquo;</strong> people, people with a <strong>&ldquo;GOOD HEART&rdquo;</strong> may be as lost throughout eternity as what we label <strong>&ldquo;BAD PEOPLE&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p>Being spiritually lost, doesn&rsquo;t mean being a horrible person, or a horrible sinner, committing horrible crimes, serious offenses, or a serial killer! <strong>SPIRITUALLY LOST means being OK without God!</strong> It means being OK with religion! It means God is not at the center of your life! It means God is not a relationship that is renewing you every day! It means you fulfill a religious duty once a week, or even daily, but God is not the driving force of your life! And, perhaps, you couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between your good life and a life with God or a life without God! Isn&rsquo;t that tragic?</p>
<p>What matters most to God, Friend, is your relationship with Him. What matters most to God about your wife, your husband, your children, your friends, your co-workers, people in the community, is their relationship with God. Eternity is on the balance! And you are God&rsquo;s messenger to them! If you don&rsquo;t know the difference between being saved and being lost, you probably can not see the difference in others either!</p>
<h2 id="power-of-grace">Power of Grace <a href="#power-of-grace" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Grace in the Bible is the undeserved gift of eternal life, (John 3: 16, 17-The Message) God grants to a human being who accepts his sinful condition, and accepts Jesus as His Redeemer.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:7-10 (The Message) is one of the most liberating messages of the Bible. It dismantles RELIGION totally! I call it the &ldquo;RELIGION DEMOLITION&rdquo; message directly from the heart of God. ([My notes]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now God has [YOU] where he wants [YOU],</p>
<p>with all the time in this world and the next [God has all the time in the world. There is NO anxiety! God&rsquo;s journey begins with REST! No hurry]</p>
<p>to shower grace and kindness upon [YOU] in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Saving is all his idea, and all his work.</strong> [No religion, theologian or denomination can claim this one. IT&rsquo;S ALL GOD&rsquo;S IDEA]</p>
<p><strong>All we do is trust him enough to LET HIM DO IT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s gift from start to finish!</strong> We don&rsquo;t play the major role. If we did, we&rsquo;d probably go around bragging that we&rsquo;d done the whole thing!</p>
<p>No, <strong>we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving.</strong> He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did you know that “Grace” (The Gift of God, salvation, eternal life) is harder to accept than to reject it? It sounds crazy, uh? Sin has impacted our psyche in such a way that we struggle to accept love and grace. We have such a low concept of ourselves that we constantly find it easier to give, produce, work for something, and get a reward for it, than it is to accept anything because we are LOVED. We don’t know what to do with undeserved love!</p>
<p>Religious people have made it to appear that the narrow gate is so because of demands God places on us, which are very tedious to fulfill. Like the BIG 10! Right? Have you heard that view in religious circles? It sounds like you have to jump on a behavioral treadmill, and try to be perfect, keep trying and trying… because otherwise you will miss heaven or paradise. All the religions of the world teach this view, except God Himself. All religions are rooted in a reward system based on good or bad behavior. Did you know that?</p>
<p>The narrow gate is so, because it requires you to leave all your human baggage at the door! Can you see the image? The door is narrow, you can not fit through it with your big luggage!</p>
<p>Jesus reduced the BIG 10 to 2, and the 2 to 1: LOVE. (Matthew 22: 37, 38-The Message) You can not love God, yourself, or people, unless you accept the love of God, first! You can not keep the BIG 10 unless you learn to love from God Himself! (1 John 4: 19-The Message) The human attempt to obey God is human baggage at the door!</p>
<p>By human baggage I imply all of your GOOD and BAD deeds. All your goodness, intentions, resolutions, and EFFORTS to be good! The narrow gate requires freedom from human baggage, that can only be found in God! Surrendering is the answer to the challenge of the “narrow gate,” not trying to obey God! When you surrender to God, He transforms your heart, your tendencies, and you find yourself obeying God, and responding to life like He would!</p>
<p>SINNERS, who accept God in their lives, (Read the parable of the prodigal son, Luke 15: 11-32) make it easier through the narrow door, than religious people with all their attempts to be good and better.</p>
<p>Amazing Grace! Have you experienced the GRACE of God in your life?</p>
<h2 id="the-invitation">The Invitation <a href="#the-invitation" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The Bible says about the human nature in Romans 3: 10-12 (The Message)</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;There’s NOBODY living right, NOT EVEN ONE, NOBODY who knows the score, NOBODY ALERT FOR GOD. They&rsquo;ve ALL taken the wrong turn; they&rsquo;ve ALL wandered down blind alleys. NO ONE&rsquo;S living right; I can’t find A SINGLE ONE. Their throats are gaping graves, their tongues slick as mudslides. Every word they speak is tinged with poison. They open their mouths and pollute the air. They race for the honor of sinner-of-the-year, litter the land with heartbreak and ruin. DON&rsquo;T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT LIVING WITH OTHERS. They never give God the time of day.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Do you struggle with your marriage? The reason is because you are broken. We all are. Relationships are troubled an conflicted. <strong>We don&rsquo;t know the first thing about living with others</strong>, says God! You may be very religious, but lousy at relationships. We all are! We are control freaks by nature. We hurt people with our words, our tone of voice, our selfishness, our judgments. Our reactions are like knives on the throats of others.</p>
<p>The human condition is sick, fragmented and broken, even if we don&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>
<p>So, the final question, the bottom line, is not whether you need God or not, but whether <strong>you acknowledge you need God or not!</strong></p>
<p>Have you been trying hard to be good? Are you exhausted? Tired of trying to do better? See yourself failing over and over again? Do see glimpses of your brokenness here and there?</p>
<p>Here is Jesus&rsquo;s invitation to you and me:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and lightly.&rdquo;</strong> Matthew 11: 28-30 (The Message)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your bottom line? Are you open to God? If not, why not?</p>
<p>What is the <strong>TRUTH</strong> of any matter?</p>
<p>Truth is most often used to mean in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or to a standard or ideal.</p>
<p>The commonly understood <strong>opposite</strong> of truth is falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy and religion. Many human activities depend upon the concept, which is assumed rather than a subject of discussion, including science, law, and everyday life.</p>
<p>Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars and philosophers. Language and words are a means by which humans convey information to one another and the method used to determine what is a &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is termed a criterion of truth.</p>
<p>There are differing claims on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are truthbearers capable of being true or false; how to define and identify truth; the roles that revealed and acquired knowledge play; and whether truth is subjective or objective, relative or absolute.</p>
<p>Many religions consider perfect knowledge of all truth about all things (omniscience) to be an attribute of a divine or supernatural being.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus was amazingly powerful in his definition of TRUTH.</strong> Out of context, it could perhaps be considered the most arrogant statement of all times. No one ever claimed this definition of truth.</p>
<p>Jesus was either God, or He was the greatest deceiver that ever walked on the face of the planet.</p>
<p>John 14: 6 - <strong>&ldquo;Jesus said, I am the truth!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Jesus proposition is simple when it comes to spiritual &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; Spiritual or religious truth is not a set of dogmas, doctrines, theological statements, presuppositions, discoveries, but <strong>ONLY</strong> relational. No one has ever claimed this so poignantly. Of course there have been &ldquo;masters,&rdquo; &ldquo;sages,&rdquo; &ldquo;wise men,&rdquo; through the ages that pointed to the fact that by &ldquo;association&rdquo; or &ldquo;discipleship&rdquo; we could learn their &ldquo;truth&rdquo; or a &ldquo;bigger truth.&rdquo; But Jesus doesn&rsquo;t say any of it. He simple say, <strong>&ldquo;I, am the TRUTH!&rdquo;</strong> Jesus is God! In other words, <strong>&ldquo;Truth can only be found relationally as we get to know God!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Want <strong>TRUTH?</strong> Walk with God. Spend time reading your Bible. Spent time praying. Spend time meditating. Spend time sharing God with people. Every time you spend time <strong>WITH</strong> God, doing what He <strong>DOES,</strong> reaching people for the Kingdom, <strong>LOVING,</strong> feeding the poor, listening to people, affirming them, loving them, you are actually <strong>KNOWING TRUTH!</strong> Isn&rsquo;t that a fascinating paradigm?</p>
<p>Spend time with Jesus, reaching people for the Kingdom, following God&rsquo;s passion, and you will <strong>know TRUTH!</strong></p>
<p><strong>TRUTH</strong> is always relational when it comes to God. Doing your own religious things and trying to discover truth in the Bible is really a waste of time. You know who said that? Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>“You have your heads in your Bibles constantly because you think you’ll find eternal life there. But you miss the forest for the trees. These Scriptures are all about me! And here I am, standing right before you, and you aren&rsquo;t willing to receive from me the life you say you want.&quot;</strong> John 5: 39-40 (The Message)</p>
