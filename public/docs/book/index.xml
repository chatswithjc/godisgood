      <description>Why I Wrote It # My hope with this book is that you give God another chance. Whether you don&amp;rsquo;t think God is real, or can be known or if religious has let you down, it&amp;rsquo;s never too late to give God a try.
My Story # My story is common to everyone. I have experienced the suffering of mental health (anxiety, depression, obsession, fear), addictions, religion and am here to say no one is beyond healing, rescue, repair in Jesus.</description>

      <title>Your Purpose</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We humans keep brainstorming options and plans, BUT God&amp;rsquo;s PURPOSE prevails.&amp;rdquo; Proverbs 19:21 (The Message)
Everything, is either caused by God, or allowed by God. You either believe in the supreme, unlimited, power of God or not! You either believe that when you surrender to God, He takes over totally, or you live with a part-time God the rest of your life.
There are no accidents in God&amp;rsquo;s universe
Our human understanding has a limited comprehension of such God, who loves, cares, produces miracles, intervenes, protects, allows painful experiences to happen.</description>

      <description>Regardless of your age at this moment, God has been watching you since the day you were born. God has been allowing things to happen or not to happen. There is no room for arrogance in God’s universe. Yes, you made choices, but your choices were enabled because God let it happen! When God chooses to override your freedom of choice, you are DONE, Friend! God is the supreme manager of the entire universe.</description>

      <title>Power of Belief</title>

      <description>When Jesus was crucified, it was an enormous shock to His followers. They secretly expected Him to establish His kingdom on earth when pushed against the wall! They saw how Jesus was mistreated. To the last moment, they waited for a divine manifestation of power to take care of Jesus, and prove to the world He was indeed the Messiah, the liberator of the Jewish nation. They figured out that if Jesus was able to heal the sick, provide food to crowds out of nothing, wine out of water, He could also perform a miracle in His behalf!</description>

      <description>God is beyond our imagination. I have always loved contrasts. I am fascinated by contrasts and opposites. It intrigues me.
 God is the superlative of contrasts and extremes. If you define the &amp;ldquo;ends&amp;rdquo; of God, with &amp;ldquo;poles&amp;rdquo; like the south and the north pole, God&amp;rsquo;s extremes would go so far, that would would never see both ends. Beyond your wildest imagination is God!  Who Is God? Your browser does not support the audio element.</description>

      <description>Religion teaches you that you have to do a bunch of things to reach perfection in the eyes of God. Nothing could ever be further from the truth of God! You are born forgiven, though imperfect. If you believe and walk on the state of perfection God has declared for you, you will die forgiven, though imperfect. You are perfect by God&amp;rsquo;s TOTAL, complete forgiveness, though you will always remain imperfect as a human being!</description>

      <description>GOD CARES! GOD LOVES YOU! GOD WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED! All of our teachings, studies, conversations are rooted in that one single principle. That&amp;rsquo;s why we don&amp;rsquo;t believe in RELIGION. We believe that a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD will make you understand how much God loves you! Once you get that in your brain, the rest is easy stuff! Religion and denominations make it complicated, God wants you and I to understand the basics!</description>

      <title>The Gospel is Good News</title>

      <description>What is the Gospel?? I don’t think most people really know.
  People are not going to fully appreciate the good news until they first know the bad news. The bad news is that we have ALL have sinned against God and have fallen short of His standards. Good and bad people alike! Our nature is fragmented. Our condition, just by breathing on this planet and having our parents genes, is SINFUL.</description>

      <description>The Uniqueness of Christ Your browser does not support the audio element.   Jesus is The Ultimate Answer Your browser does not support the audio element.   Even though Jesus Christ is equal to God, he never spoke of Himself while on earth, but always spoke what He heard from His Heavenly Father. He was never selfish, but always God-centered.
“And being found in appearance as a man, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.</description>

      <description>Feeling Lost? # &amp;ldquo;Suppose one of you had a hundred sheep and lost one. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until you found it? When found, you can be sure you would put it across your shoulders, rejoicing, and when you got home call in your friends and neighbors, saying, &amp;lsquo;Celebrate with me! I&amp;rsquo;ve found my lost sheep!&amp;rsquo; Count on it—THERE&amp;rsquo;S MORE JOY IN HEAVEN OVER ONE SINNER&amp;rsquo;S RESCUED LIFE THAN OVER NINETY-NINE GOOD PEOPLE IN NO NEED OF RESCUE.</description>
