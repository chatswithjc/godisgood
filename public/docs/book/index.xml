      <description>There are no accidents in God&amp;rsquo;s universe, Friend
Everything, is either caused by God, or allowed by God. You either believe in the supreme, unlimited, power of God or not! You either believe that when you surrender to God, He takes over totally, or you live with a part-time God the rest of your life.
Our human understanding has a limited comprehension of such God, who loves, cares, produces miracles, intervenes, protects, allows painful experiences to happen.</description>

      <description>Regardless of your age at this moment, God has been watching you since the day you were born. God has been allowing things to happen or not to happen. There is no room for arrogance in Godâ€™s universe. Yes, you made choices, but your choices were enabled because God let it happen! When God chooses to override your freedom of choice, you are DONE, Friend! God is the supreme manager of the entire universe.</description>
