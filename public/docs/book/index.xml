      <description>Why I wrote it # My Story # Who is this book for? # TL;DR (Too Long Didn&amp;rsquo;t Read) #  Grace: You are enough. God is enough. LET GOD LOVE YOU, LIVE LOVED, LEARN TO LOVE GOD by seeking what matters to God on this earth (Kingdom) and consider God&amp;rsquo;s way of doing things (righteousness). &amp;ldquo;Seeking the Kingdom of God&amp;rdquo; is not a religious act. It&amp;rsquo;s a RELATIONAL enterprise. It&amp;rsquo;s an attitude of vulnerability.</description>

      <description>There are no accidents in God&amp;rsquo;s universe, Friend
&amp;ldquo;We humans keep brainstorming options and plans, BUT God&amp;rsquo;s PURPOSE prevails.&amp;rdquo; Proverbs 19:21 (The Message)
Everything, is either caused by God, or allowed by God. You either believe in the supreme, unlimited, power of God or not! You either believe that when you surrender to God, He takes over totally, or you live with a part-time God the rest of your life.</description>

      <description>Regardless of your age at this moment, God has been watching you since the day you were born. God has been allowing things to happen or not to happen. There is no room for arrogance in God’s universe. Yes, you made choices, but your choices were enabled because God let it happen! When God chooses to override your freedom of choice, you are DONE, Friend! God is the supreme manager of the entire universe.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Suppose one of you had a hundred sheep and lost one. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until you found it? When found, you can be sure you would put it across your shoulders, rejoicing, and when you got home call in your friends and neighbors, saying, &amp;lsquo;Celebrate with me! I&amp;rsquo;ve found my lost sheep!&amp;rsquo; Count on it—THERE&amp;rsquo;S MORE JOY IN HEAVEN OVER ONE SINNER&amp;rsquo;S RESCUED LIFE THAN OVER NINETY-NINE GOOD PEOPLE IN NO NEED OF RESCUE.</description>

      <description>God is beyond our imagination. I have always loved contrasts. I am fascinated by contrasts and opposites. It intrigues me.
 God is the superlative of contrasts and extremes. If you define the &amp;ldquo;ends&amp;rdquo; of God, with &amp;ldquo;poles&amp;rdquo; like the south and the north pole, God&amp;rsquo;s extremes would go so far, that would would never see both ends. Beyond your wildest imagination is God!  Psalm 8 (The Message). There was no Hubble telescope when King David wrote this hymn.</description>

      <title>God Cares</title>

      <description>GOD CARES! GOD LOVES YOU! GOD WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED! All of our teachings, studies, conversations are rooted in that one single principle. That&amp;rsquo;s why we don&amp;rsquo;t believe in RELIGION. We believe that a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD will make you understand how much God loves you! Once you get that in your brain, the rest is easy stuff! Religion and denominations make it complicated, God wants you and I to understand the basics!</description>

      <title>The Gospel is Good News</title>
      <link>https://godisgood.io/docs/book/gospel-good-news/</link>

      <description>What is the Gospel?? I don’t think most people really know.
  People are not going to fully appreciate the good news until they first know the bad news. The bad news is that we have ALL have sinned against God and have fallen short of His standards. Good and bad people alike! Our nature is fragmented. Our condition, just by breathing on this planet and having our parents genes, is SINFUL.</description>

      <title>Who is Jesus Christ?</title>
      <link>https://godisgood.io/docs/book/who-is-jesus-christ/</link>

      <description>Jesus explained, “I am the Way, I am the Truth, and I am the Life. No one comes next to the Father except through union with me. To know me is to know my Father too. John 14:6 TPT
Even though Jesus Christ is equal to God, he never spoke of Himself while on earth, but always spoke what He heard from His Heavenly Father. He was never selfish, but always God-centered.</description>

      <title>Suffering and The Cross</title>
      <link>https://godisgood.io/docs/book/the-cross/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;IT IS FINISHED!&amp;rdquo; (John 19:30)
These are the most important words in the Bible. When a follower of God understands the real meaning of those words the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus become an epiphany of glory and praise!
The cross was the goal of Jesus from the time He was born in Bethlehem by a miracle of God. His birth was so there would be His death. &amp;ldquo;Immanuel,&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;God with us,&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 1: 23) was made possible for you and me.</description>

      <title>Salvation is Free</title>

      <description>Grace in the Bible is the undeserved gift of eternal life, (John 3: 16, 17-The Message) God grants to a human being who accepts his sinful condition, and accepts Jesus as His Redeemer.
Ephesians 2:7-10 (The Message) is one of the most liberating messages of the Bible. It dismantles RELIGION totally! I call it the &amp;ldquo;RELIGION DEMOLITION&amp;rdquo; message directly from the heart of God. ([My notes]
&amp;ldquo;Now God has [YOU] where he wants [YOU],</description>
