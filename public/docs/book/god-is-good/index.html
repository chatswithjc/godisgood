<li><strong>God is the superlative of contrasts and extremes. If you define the &ldquo;ends&rdquo; of God, with &ldquo;poles&rdquo; like the south and the north pole, God&rsquo;s extremes would go so far, that would would never see both ends. Beyond your wildest imagination is God!</strong></li>

<p>Psalm 8 (The Message). There was no Hubble telescope when King David wrote this hymn. It make the Bible even greater! Almost 4.000 years ago, David was describing what we see today! Amazing, the greatness of God, Almighty!</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God, brilliant Lord, yours is a household name. Nursing infants gurgle choruses about you; toddlers shout the songs that drown out enemy talk, and silence atheist babble.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>**&ldquo;I look up at your MACRO-SKIES, dark and enormous,</p>
<p>your handmade sky-jewelry, moon and stars mounted in their settings. Then I look at my MICRO-SELF and wonder, Why do you bother with us? Why take a second look our way?&rdquo;**</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Yet we&rsquo;ve so narrowly missed being gods, bright with Eden’s dawn light. You put us in charge of your handcrafted world, repeated to us your Genesis-charge, Made us lords of sheep and cattle, even animals out in the wild, Birds flying and fish swimming, whales singing in the ocean deeps.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God, brilliant Lord, your name echoes around the world.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you wonder why Lucifer turned against God? He gave &ldquo;created humans&rdquo; more than what he ever got. I believe Lucifer found out about God&rsquo;s plan to create such an amazing world for these new creatures with the ability to pro-create themselves, enjoy life, pleasure, love, each other, and he went ballistic! Envy ate him alive! It was &ldquo;us&rdquo; that antagonized Lucifer against God. Envy. Greed. Pride. His broken religion and idolatry drove him crazy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God&rsquo;s universe is beyond what we understand. So vast. How many planets are inhabited beyond Hubble? How many natural scenes from &ldquo;another world&rdquo; are there to be discovered and explored? Yet, God chose planet earth to be the capital of His universe? He put everything on the line for you and me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And&hellip; <strong>God is here with us? With you and me, 24/7?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same power that created 100 billion galaxies, is the same power God has available to love you in our infirmities, in your temptations, at the moments when you fall, when you doubt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He forgives your sins—every one.
He heals your diseases—every one.
He redeems you from hell—saves your life!
He crowns you with love and mercy—a paradise crown.
He wraps you in goodness—beauty eternal.
He renews your youth—you&rsquo;re always young in his presence.
God MAKES EVERYTHING COME OUT RIGHT;
HE PUTS VICTIMS BACK ON THEIR FEET.
He showed Moses how he went about his work,
opened up his plans to all Israel.
God is sheer mercy and grace;
NOT EASILY ANGERED, he&rsquo;s rich in love.
He doesn&rsquo;t endlessly nag and scold,
nor hold grudges forever.
He doesn&rsquo;t treat us as our sins deserve,
nor pay us back in full for our wrongs.
As high as heaven is over the earth,
so strong is his LOVE to those who fear him.
And as far as sunrise is from sunset,
he has separated us from our sins.
As parents feel for their children,
God feels for those who fear him.
He knows us inside and out,
keeps in mind that we&rsquo;re made of mud.
Men and women don&rsquo;t live very long;
like wildflowers they spring up and blossom,
But a storm snuffs them out just as quickly,
leaving nothing to show they were here.
God&rsquo;s LOVE, though, is ever and always,
eternally present to all who fear him,
Making everything right for them and their children
God has set his throne in heaven;
he rules over us all. He&rsquo;s the King!</p>
<ul>
<li>Psalm 103, Message</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you trust God today? He is watching everything. He knows everything. He won’t drop you.</p>
<p>King David composed a song to declare the goodness of God. One of my favorites Psalms. Psalm 145:8-21 (The Message)</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God is ALL mercy and grace—not quick to anger, is rich in love.</strong></p>
<p><strong>God is good to one and all; everything he does is suffused with grace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creation and creatures applaud you, God; your holy people bless you. They talk about the glories of your rule, they exclaim over your splendor, letting the world know of your power for good, the lavish splendor of your kingdom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your kingdom is a kingdom eternal; YOU NEVER GET VOTED OUT OF OFFICE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>God always does what he says, and is GRACIOUS in everything he does.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOD GIVES A HAND TO THOSE DOWN ON THEIR LUCK, GIVES A FRESH START TO THOSE READY TO QUIT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All eyes are on you, expectant; you give them their meals on time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GENEROUS TO A FAULT, you lavish your favor on all creatures.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everything God does is right—the trademark on all his works is love.</strong></p>
<p><strong>God&rsquo;s there, listening for all who pray, for all who pray and mean it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He does what&rsquo;s best for those who fear him—hears them call out, and saves them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOD STICKS BY ALL WHO LOVE HIM, BUT IT&rsquo;S ALL OVER FOR THOSE WHO DON&rsquo;T.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My mouth is filled with God&rsquo;s praise. Let everything living bless him, bless his holy name from now to eternity!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The God King David described in this Psalm <strong>IS MY GOD, Friend!</strong> That&rsquo;s the God that melts my heart! That&rsquo;s the God that drives me, and moves me to do what I do! He has been good to me beyond my wildest dreams!</p>
<p>“God is good!” has become my mantra, when people question things, when people write about their most inner secrets. God is always good! I believe that religion misses the goodness of God, in attempting to make sure people get God’s holiness, justice and wrath. God’s holiness is rooted in His love. God’s justice is based on His love. God’s wrath is driven by a love that is beyond our comprehension. We don’t have a mind to understand the holy passion of God for humanity! The cross, the death of Jesus, what he endured only give us glimpses of a LOVE that beyond our rational grasp!</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, NOT REALIZING THAT GOD&rsquo;S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?&rdquo;</strong> Romans 2:4 (NIV)</p>
<p>Do you realize, Friend, that God&rsquo;s goodness, grace and compassion is intended to melt your heart? His goodness is intended to make you feel loved, cared for, so in turn you can love others? You are not just one more in the mass of people. You are God&rsquo;s special creation. There is no one else in the world like you! God is watching you day in and day out!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you <strong>let God love you</strong>, you will experience an outpouring of His presence that will drive you to be generous, give, love, care for others, tell them about God&rsquo;s gift of grace&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If God&rsquo;s love and goodness doesn&rsquo;t drive to love your spouse, your children, your friends, your co-workers, your employees, your boss, the people of your world, nothing else will! If the goodness and the extravagant love of God doesn&rsquo;t drive to give generously, nothing else will! God is good, Friend!</p>
<p>I believe God is good and He takes delight in doing good things for people. He does indeed hold our hand in times of trouble and helps us stand against the onslaught of life’s difficulties.</p>
<p>In the midst of whatever is going on in your life today, I invite you to pause and reflect on God. King David describes in powerful words, God’s character. We can verily grasp the depth of these words.</p>
<p>King David composed a song to declare the goodness of God. One of my favorites Psalms. Psalm 145:8-21 (The Message)</p>
<p>“God is ALL mercy and grace—not quick to anger, is rich in love.</p>
<p>God is good to one and all; everything he does is suffused with grace.</p>
<p>Creation and creatures applaud you, God; your holy people bless you. They talk about the glories of your rule, they exclaim over your splendor, letting the world know of your power for good, the lavish splendor of your kingdom.</p>
<p>Your kingdom is a kingdom eternal; YOU NEVER GET VOTED OUT OF OFFICE.</p>
<p>God always does what he says, and is GRACIOUS in everything he does.</p>
<p>GOD GIVES A HAND TO THOSE DOWN ON THEIR LUCK, GIVES A FRESH START TO THOSE READY TO QUIT.</p>
<p>All eyes are on you, expectant; you give them their meals on time.</p>
<p>GENEROUS TO A FAULT, you lavish your favor on all creatures.</p>
<p>Everything God does is right—the trademark on all his works is love.</p>
<p>God’s there, listening for all who pray, for all who pray and mean it.</p>
<p>He does what’s best for those who fear him—hears them call out, and saves them.</p>
<p>GOD STICKS BY ALL WHO LOVE HIM, BUT IT’S ALL OVER FOR THOSE WHO DON’T.</p>
<p>My mouth is filled with God’s praise. Let everything living bless him, bless his holy name from now to eternity!&quot;</p>
<p>The God King David described in this Psalm IS MY GOD, Friend! That’s the God that melts my heart! That’s the God that drives me, and moves me to do what I do! He has been good to me beyond my wildest dreams! I don’t know any other God!</p>
<p>“Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, NOT REALIZING THAT GOD’S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?&quot; (Romans 2:4 (NIV))</p>
<p>Do you realize, Friend, that God’s goodness, grace and compassion is intended to melt your heart? His goodness is intended to make you feel loved, cared for, so in turn you can love others? You are not just one more in the mass of people. You are God’s special creation. There is no one else in the world like you! God is watching you day in and day out!</p>
<p>If you let God love you, you will experience an outpouring of His presence that will drive you to be generous, give, love, care for others, tell them about God’s gift of grace…</p>
<p>If God’s love and goodness doesn’t drive to love your spouse, your children, your friends, your co-workers, your employees, your boss, the people of your world, nothing else will! If the goodness and the extravagant love of God doesn’t drive to give generously, nothing else will! God is good, Friend!</p>
<p>If you let God love you, you will experience an outpouring of His presence that will drive you to be generous, give, love, care for others, tell them about God&rsquo;s gift of grace.</p>
<p>The Great Controversy between God and the devil has already been won! When Jesus died on the cross, on a Friday evening and said, &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; He meant what He said: &ldquo;It is done.&rdquo; The Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, became a symbol of the finished work of God in the Universe. REST for those who walk with God. Sunday, was the beginning of a new chapter. The resurrection of Jesus! He did no only rest from the work of SALVATION on behalf of humanity, but He sealed it with a new victory&hellip; <strong>ETERNAL LIFE!</strong></p>
<p>God is the victor for ever! Satan has been defeated for ever! So, whose side are you on?</p>
