				<p>You are experiencing the final days of &ldquo;last days&rdquo; of this age. Jesus is coming back in the flesh very soon! The Bible gave us a lot of clues about when the end of this age will come, and those signs are all around us! This is very exciting! However, we must wake up</p>
<p>For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. ‘Immediately after the distress of those days ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.  Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. <em>(Matthew 24:27-34)</em></p>
<p><strong>There are 4 kids of responses to the &ldquo;time of the end.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) People who deny and refuse to get involved in prophecies regarding the &ldquo;time of the end.&rdquo; This is the majority of the world. All 5 largest world religions refuse to deal with &ldquo;time of the end&rdquo; because of its complication, fear elements, and in credible diversity.</strong> Why do you think Noah preached 120 years, and <strong>NO ONE</strong> except his family were saved? Same today. <em>(Mathew 24:37)</em></p>
<p><strong>2) People who obsess over &ldquo;time of the end&rdquo; prophecies, theories of interpretation, charts, conspiracy theories, esoteric information, date setting, and predictions.</strong> Very often behind this drive there is an obsession for tangibility, <strong>idolatrous knowledge,</strong> and let&rsquo;s face it an intense lust for results. <strong>Fear</strong> creates results, followers, and <strong>money.</strong> People pay for pleasure and fear.</p>
<p><strong>3) Denominations, cults, and groups who use &ldquo;time of the end&rdquo; information to elevate themselves and define WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG. This approach creates a &ldquo;we versus the rest&rdquo; mindset that is also very reassuring. Group mind is very powerful.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) Those honestly accept the main prophetic pillars that point to the &ldquo;time of the end,&rdquo; but do not obsess over details.</strong> How do you know when you are stepping into a territory not blessed by God? Simple. When 27 other &ldquo;time of the end&rdquo; experts are fighting regarding details and they all disagree on the details.</p>
<p>Seek to understand and believe the signs of the times as presented in the Bible. Do not obsessed over details because I promise you, for every detail you believe, someone else will come and tell you, you are wrong!</p>
<h2 id="satans-final-last-days-deception">Satan&rsquo;s Final Last Days Deception <a href="#satans-final-last-days-deception" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Your BRAIN, your MIND is the territory the devil seeks; control of the physical just follows the control of your BRAIN.</p>
<p>Look at 2 Corinthians 4:4.</p>
<p>What part of your SELF does the devil blind? Its not the physical eyes, <strong>HE IS AFTER YOUR BRAIN, your MIND!</strong> He wants to slowly align those 100 billion neurons to work efficiently for him, until he gets total possession. The Greek word for mind is &ldquo;<em>novhma Noema</em>&rdquo;, which translates <strong>mental thought or perception, that which thinks.</strong> Here is where Satan fights for control. All for the purpose of blinding you from the truth of God. He uses a variety of tools, strategies, skills to win the battle of your brain.</p>
<p>How you THINK, the inner-person YOU are, guides your perceptions. Here is where Satan is at work, and here is where the Bible warns us to set our guard. God’s word implores with you to protect YOUR BRAIN against the ways of this world, which are demonic in nature.</p>
<p>Satan and his fallen-angels, through the proxy of fallen-humanity, battle for the control of YOUR BRAIN. When a person surrenders to God, their perceptions change, because the Spirit of God, the presence of God, the Holy Spirit is now GUIDING THE BRAIN, THE THOUGHTS, THE MIND, THE WILL in a different direction. Satan looses total control over their mind. The kingdom of God has advanced on his territory.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The heart is hopelessly dark and deceitful, a puzzle that NO ONE can figure out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But I, God, search the heart and examine the mind. I get to the heart of the human. I get to the root of things. I treat them as they really are, not as they pretend to be.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>While religion, morality and culture define what&rsquo;s &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, God always goes deeper! The world says, &ldquo;Do what your heart tells you. Follow your heart.&rdquo; That is a creed believed by millions today. It is one of the great cultural myths of the Western world, a gospel proclaimed in many movies and songs and television programs and stories. People spend hours watching movies that promote one of the devil&rsquo;s most accepted myths! Not only that, what they wouldn&rsquo;t dare do openly, because of the judgmental legalism and morality they would face, they live, accept, and caress in the depths of their hearts. Thus, their walk with God is incongruent! They follow religion, but in their fantasy world, they follow the devil! God says, &ldquo;Your heart is deceitful.&rdquo; Even, when it looks like you are obeying the 10 commandments, and have the truth, and follow the truth, and do the religious stuff. <em>(Rich Young Ruler Mark 10:17-27)</em> Under all of that, there is a deeper reality. The condition of your heart is what God looks at! Your heart matters to God, more than your outward behavior! Your heart must be filled by God&rsquo;s presence, and His drive, to do His will, then your behavior will reflect it! I don&rsquo;t believe in judging externals. It is deceiving. Religion does that all the time. Whether it&rsquo;s adultery, homosexuality, abortion or whatever! Externals are always deceiving. When a person surrenders to God, and accepts Him in his/her heart, God changes people from the inside out. There is peace. There is harmony. The fruit of the Spirit blossoms fully. Galatians 5 (The Message) We need a higher standard of authority than our heart, our feelings, our emotions. A higher standard of authority than mere opinion from the culture, from morality, legalism, and religion. We must ask God to seek the depths of our hearts. That takes time. It takes a walk with God. It takes listening to God. It takes a commitment to reading God&rsquo;s Word in its totality. It takes prayer. And above all things it takes a humble heart! The problem we have today is a watered-down gospel. Religion has replaced the radical call of Jesus to look deep into our hearts. That&rsquo;s why religion is so quick to judge some sins such as adultery, <strong>and very, very, very slow to call on the deeper sins of the heart: namely, pride, greed, materialism, money obsession, and insensitivity towards poverty, and injustice.</strong> Because of that, many have a watered-down understanding of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, a follower of God. We have Christians who have become so much like the world, that the world doesn&rsquo;t even want to become like them. Remember Peter? And this is the truth! Have you ever watched Christians in &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; circles trying to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and be &ldquo;cool.&rdquo;? Here is the truth, Friend. What was considered normal followship of Christ in the first and the second century, before Christianity became an institution, would be considered <strong>RADICAL</strong> by today&rsquo;s standards. But that is what we need today: <strong>RADICAL FOLLOWERS OF GOD.</strong> To put it another way, we need followers of God that are willing to stand for God no matter what. We need followers of God that know that the only real <strong>TRUTH</strong> is the one God reveals in the heart! God transforms the human heart. The human heart without God is deceiving. I see all day long the results of behavior caused by the human heart. Give God a chance, Friend! Instead of trying to accommodate the Word of God to our changing culture, we need to accommodate our culture to the unchanging Word of God.</p>

<p>We live in a time when increasingly numbers of people, from all walks of life, are familiar with the phrase, &ldquo;time of the end,&rdquo; or &ldquo;apocalypse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are 5 things you need to know about the time of the end.</p>
<p><strong>1) The condition of the world before the coming of Jesus. Matthew 24:12</strong></p>
<p>“In the confusion, [time of the end] lying preachers [false religion] will come forward and deceive a lot of people. For many others, the overwhelming spread of evil will do them in—nothing left of their love but a mound of ashes.&quot; <strong>&ldquo;The love of most will grow cold.&rdquo;</strong> (NIV)</p>
<p>Three aspects deserve attention from this passage.</p>
<p>False religion</p>
<p>The five major religions of the world are infested with errors and erroneous concepts about God. Religion is driving much of the confusion of the world. I define religion: <strong>&ldquo;As the human attempt to conceptualize, systematize, define, anthropomorphize (project humanity on God), use God to drive human behavior, create morality, question Him, (agnosticism), or reject His existence (atheism). All for the purpose to affect human behavior.</strong> <strong>Religion</strong> begins with the human search. A <strong>relationship</strong> with God begins with Him reaching out to humanity. Thus, He invites us <strong>FIRST</strong> to let Him love us.</p>
<p>I believe there are followers of God all around the world, who are hearing the voice of God and following Him in their personal lives. These people come from all walks of life, all religions and persuasions.</p>
<p>Chaotic conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate change, natural disasters</li>
<li>Hostilities among nations</li>
<li>Military or militarized conflicts in the US, and geopolitical regions of the words</li>
<li>Economic crisis</li>
<li>Conflicts between the &ldquo;left&rdquo; (the majority of the world, poor, oppressed), and the right (1%, 10%, greed, political powers)</li>
<li>Pandemics</li>
<li>Hopelessness and loss of meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people will lose their ability to love, and accept love.</p>
<p><strong>The absence of love will increasingly create the vacum for violence to escalate at all levels.</strong> Loveless marriages, divorce, generational tensions, lack of compassion, greed, and demonic forces driving people to do the unthinkable.</p>
<p>Word of Jesus about conditions in the time of the end. Matthew 24 (The Message)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later as he [Jesus] was sitting on Mount Olives, his disciples approached and asked him, <strong>“Tell us, when are these things going to happen? What will be the sign of your coming, that the time’s up?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>[False religion]</strong> &ldquo;Jesus said, <strong>“Watch out for doomsday deceivers.</strong> Many leaders are going to show up with forged identities, claiming, ‘I am Christ, the Messiah.’ They will deceive a lot of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[Armed conflicts]</strong> &ldquo;When reports come in of wars and rumored wars, keep your head and don’t panic. This is routine history; this is no sign of the end. Nation will fight nation and ruler fight ruler, over and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[Natural disasters]</strong> &ldquo;Famines and earthquakes will occur in various places. This is nothing compared to what is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[Persecution - Violence]</strong> “They are going to throw you to the wolves and kill you, everyone hating you because you carry my name. And then, going from bad to worse, it will be dog-eat-dog, everyone at each other’s throat, everyone hating each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[False religion - Chaos - Absence of love]</strong> “In the confusion, lying preachers will come forward and deceive a lot of people. For many others, the overwhelming spread of evil will do them in—nothing left of their love but a mound of ashes.</p>
<p><strong>[Key to victory for followers of God]</strong> “Staying with it—that’s what God requires. Stay with it to the end. <strong>You won’t be sorry, and you’ll be saved. All during this time, the good news—the Message of the kingdom—will be preached all over the world, a witness staked out in every country. And then the end will come.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[AntiChrist-Mark of the beast-Religio-political allegiance (Daniel-Revelation)]</strong> “But be ready to run for it when you see the monster of desecration set up in the Temple sanctuary. The prophet Daniel described this. If you’ve read Daniel, you’ll know what I’m talking about. If you’re living in Judea at the time, run for the hills; if you’re working in the yard, don’t return to the house to get anything; if you’re out in the field, don’t go back and get your coat. Pregnant and nursing mothers will have it especially hard.</p>
<p><strong>[Chaotic conditions as never seen-God will put an end before the world self-destroys]</strong> “This is going to be trouble on a scale beyond what the world has ever seen, or will see again. If these days of trouble were left to run their course, nobody would make it. <strong>But on account of God’s chosen people,</strong> [you, Friend] <strong>the trouble will be cut short.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[False religion]</strong> “If anyone tries to flag you down, calling out, ‘Here’s the Messiah!’ or points, ‘There he is!’ don’t fall for it. <strong>Fake Messiahs and lying preachers are going to pop up everywhere. Their impressive credentials and dazzling performances will pull the wool over the eyes of even those who ought to know better.</strong> But I&rsquo;ve given you fair warning. <strong>So if they say, ‘Run to the country and see him arrive!’ or, ‘Quick, get downtown, see him come!’ don’t give them the time of day.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The truth about the Second Coming of Jesus]</strong> &ldquo;The Arrival of the Son of Man [Jesus] isn&rsquo;t something you go to see. <strong>HE COMES like swift lightning to you!</strong> Whenever you see crowds gathering, think of carrion vultures circling, moving in, hovering over a rotting carcass. You can be quite sure that it’s not the living Son of Man pulling in those crowds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[The Second Coming of Jesus] <strong>“Then, the Arrival of the Son of Man!</strong> [Jesus] <strong>IT WILL FILL THE SKIES—NO ONE WILL MISS IT. UNREADY people all over the world, OUTSIDERS to the splendor and power, will raise a huge lament as they watch the Son of Man blazing out of heaven. At that same moment, he’ll dispatch his angels with a trumpet-blast summons, pulling in God’s chosen from the four winds, from pole to pole.</strong> [What a spectacular description]</p>
<p><strong>[SIGNS of the Second Coming of Jesus is what we have, NOT A SPECIFIC DATE. Watch out for obsessive date setting]</strong> “Take a lesson from the fig tree. From the moment you notice its buds form, the merest hint of green, you know summer’s just around the corner. So it is with you: <strong>When you see all these things, you’ll know he’s at the door.</strong> Don’t take this lightly. I’m not just saying this for some future generation, but for all of you. This age continues until all these things take place. <strong>Sky and earth will wear out; my words won’t wear out.</strong></p>
<p>“But the exact day and hour? No one knows that, not even heaven’s angels, not even the Son. Only the Father knows.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>[Conditions in the culture by the time of Jesus&rsquo; Second Coming] &ldquo;The Arrival of the Son of Man [Jesus] will take place in times like Noah’s.</strong> Before the great flood EVERYONE was carrying on as USUAL, HAVING A GOOD TIME right up to the day Noah boarded the ark. They KNEW NOTHING—until the flood hit and swept everything away.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[The Second Coming of Jesus will happen all of a sudden]</strong> “The Son of Man’s Arrival will be like that: Two men will be working in the field—one will be taken, one left behind; two women will be grinding at the mill—one will be taken, one left behind.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>[Warning from Jesus]</strong> &ldquo;So stay AWAKE, ALERT. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DAY YOUR MASTER WILL SHOW UP. <strong>But you do know this: You know that if the homeowner had known what time of night the burglar would arrive, he would have been there with his dogs to prevent the break-in.</strong> Be vigilant just like that. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE SON OF MAN IS GOING TO SHOW UP.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[I have to confess I get very impatient with people who try so hard to predict the time of Jesus&rsquo; coming. You can read books and books of conspiracy theories and ignore what Jesus&rsquo; said! NO ONE KNOWS! You have no idea!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This is for Pastors and leaders]</strong> “Who here qualifies for the job of overseeing the kitchen? A PERSON THE MASTER CAN DEPEND ON TO FEED THE WORKERS ON TIME EACH DAY. SOMEONE THE MASTER CAN DROP IN ON UNANNOUNCED AND ALWAYS FIND HIM DOING HIS JOB. <strong>A God-blessed man or woman, I tell you. It won’t be long before the Master will put this person in charge of the whole operation.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>[I want to be this person. People who tend to obsess about the events of Jesus coming, prediction, date setting, conspiracy theories should be avoided. Do what God has called you to do. Fulfill your purpose. <strong>Live every day as if Jesus won&rsquo;t come for 1.000 more years, be ready as He would come back tomorrow. That&rsquo;s the key.</strong> By the way, most of &ldquo;time of the end terrorists, and expert speculators&rdquo; (Pastors, teachers), are making very good money out of scaring people, and satisfying an obsessive, neurotic need to know&hellip; ]</p>
<p><strong>[Religious hypocrites]</strong> “But if that person only looks out for himself, and the minute the Master is away does what he pleases—abusing the help and throwing drunken parties for his friends—the Master is going to show up when he least expects it and make hash of him. He’ll end up in the dump with the hypocrites, out in the cold shivering, teeth chattering.”</p>
<p>Nothing can be more clear than the teachings of Jesus regarding the time of the end.</p>
<p><strong>2) The mark of God&rsquo;s followers in the time of the end. John 13:35 (The Message)</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is how EVERYONE will recognize that you are my disciples—when they see the love you have for each other.”</p>
<p>Notice it&rsquo;s not a message, doctrine or a teaching that will tell the world who are God&rsquo;s people. But the witness of <strong>LOVE, compassion, and care.</strong></p>
<p>Followers of God to let God love them, which then enables them to love others, have compassion, and not respond violently to persecution and attacks from the world. <strong>LOVE</strong> and the absence of it will divide the world in two groups: The majority of the world will be unable to love, and a small minority will continue to respond in compassion, and love to people, regardless of adverse circumstances. Most Jesus said, &ldquo;will quit loving&rdquo; (Matthew 24:12)</p>
<p>We are told by historians of the early church called &ldquo;The Way,&rdquo; (followers of Jesus. Acts 9:2 is the first mention of this church out of 6 times), that the way in which pagans and secular people <strong>KNEW</strong> followers of Jesus, was by the way they expressed love. They way they cared for each other. An anonymous onlooker from that epoch is said to have described them as, <strong>&ldquo;Look how they love each other&rdquo;</strong> They were truly a community of love and compassion. Imagine a community of wealthy people and poor, followers of God, who sell all their real estate properties, possessions, expensive cars and take the money back so everyone will have their needs taken acre of. That&rsquo;s what marked that early church. Capitalism, individualism, and the greed of Wall Street would have shocked them!</p>
<p>I know there are people who think this &ldquo;love&rdquo; concept is too soft. There must be some substance, some doctrine that will distinguish followers of God in the time of the end.</p>
<p>To those who worry about legalistic issues, obedience, doctrines, and who &ldquo;has the truth,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;when you let God love you, you will obey out of love whatever God directs you to do.&rdquo; <strong>Lovers</strong> don&rsquo;t need lessons on how to love. A young mother learns very quickly how to love her baby. Love is a driving force.</p>
<p><strong>3) The specific events to take place between now and the Second Coming of Jesus are revealed to us in the Bible as prophetic statements.</strong> God has not left us without information about the time of the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel 11, 12</li>
<li>The book of Revelation</li>
<li>Statements by Jesus</li>
<li>Statements by writers of the NT</li>
</ul>
<p>There is: <strong>1)</strong> a prophetic message in the Bible followers of God must understand, and <strong>2)</strong> a prophetic worldwide movement composed by people who choose to follow God. (This is not to be confused with &ldquo;time of the end terrorists,&rdquo; paranoid fanatics, conspiracy theories, obsessive date setting, and fear-mongering predictions.) <strong>Fear</strong> is not from God. <strong>Love</strong> is (1 John 4:18).</p>
<p>We must keep in mind what matters! The devil is in the details. If you are a follower of God, He will reveal to you what you must do. God will not leave you at the mercy of you understanding volumes of volumes of details. <strong>You must know the main sings and be ready to follow God, not the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) There will be a critical decision followers of God will have to make before the Second Coming of Jesus. Revelation 14: 9-11 (The Message)</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;A third Angel followed, shouting, warning, &lsquo;If anyone worships the Beast and its image [false religion] and takes the mark on forehead or hand, that person will drink the wine of God’s wrath, prepared unmixed in his chalice of anger&hellip; No respite for those who worship the Beast and its image, who take the mark of its name.” MEANWHILE, the saints stand passionately patient, <strong>keeping God’s commands, staying faithful to Jesus.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I believe, rooted in intense study of Biblical prophecies that <strong>the world will be called to go back to God, due to the calamities falling upon the earth. In a last desperate attempt to calm the wrath of God, religion will call the masses to go back to church. A Sunday law will be legalized and imposed as a sign of loyalty to God. Except for the fact that &ldquo;Sunday keeping&rdquo; is the mark of false religion</strong>. <strong>Those who observe the commandments of God will be called by God to observe Sabbath (Saturday) as a day of worship.</strong> That will signal the beginning of fierce persecution of followers of God by religion and political powers. Make no mistake about Sunday keeping. <strong>The Catholic Church has clearly acknowledge from the beginning the Church had the authority to change God&rsquo;s day of rest for a Church&rsquo;s chosen day. The Catholic catechism is clear. The reformation kept Sunday among all the reforms, and evangelicals today twist Scriptures, the Bible to say that Sabbath is not abiding for followers of God. I can dialogue with Catholics because the issue is not Sunday or Sabbath (Saturday) but the authority of the church and the Bible. For evangelical Christians the issue is hermeneutical maneuvering, and distortion of the Biblical text</strong>.</p>
<p>Just for your information I post one statement which shows that Protestants all follow the Catholic church.</p>
<p><strong>“The Bible everywhere enforces the sanctification of Saturday the seventh day of the week…You Protestants have to admit the authority of the Roman Catholic Church that is branded on you when you observe Sunday because you have no other authority for Sunday but that of the Roman Catholic Church.”</strong>- James Gibbons (American Catholic Cardinal, Virginia; July 23, 1834 – March 24, 1921)</p>
<p><strong>5) God&rsquo;s promise to His people in the time of the end. Daniel 12: 1-3 (The Message)</strong></p>
<p>This is a phenomenal promise for followers of God.</p>
<p>“At that time [time of the end] Michael, [Jesus], the great prince who PROTECTS YOUR PEOPLE, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. BUT at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—WILL BE DELIVERED. Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. Those who are wise[a] will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Nothing to fear, Friend! God will protect His people. There will probably be some that will die standing for God. The resurrection of saints will happen shortly after, and we will enter eternity. Are you a follower of God Friend? Are you developing a relationship with Him, so when troubled times come you can hear His voice directing you? Are you spending time with Him in prayer, learning to depend on Him, reading the Bible?</p>
