You either believe that when you surrender to God, He takes over totally, or you live with a part-time God the rest of your life.\nOur human understanding has a limited comprehension of such God, who loves, cares, produces miracles, intervenes, protects, allows painful experiences to happen.\n\u0026ldquo;Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. BUT ONE THING I DO: FORGETTING WHAT IS BEHIND AND STRAINING TOWARD WHAT IS AHEAD, I PRESS ON TOWARD the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.\u0026rdquo; Philippians 3:13-14 (NIV)\nForgetting the PAST, looking FORWARD, I PRESS ON. Can you feel the force behind these words, Friend? Total focus. Total singleness of mind and purpose. Only ONE THING matters: To press on!\nLet your entire life be rooted in God. Question everything with the eyes of one who knows God. Check everything through the filters of God\u0026rsquo;s presence in the here and now. Accept everything in faith, believing that somehow there is a reason for such event. Romans 8:28 holds the key to the best life ever! Nothing in life gets better than trusting in God.\n\u0026ldquo;And we know that all things work out for good for those who love God.\u0026rdquo;\nThis promise does not say, that everything in life will be pleasant. This is not an unconditional promise, either. It only applies to followers of God. This promise is for those who believe God is powerful to turn an ugly divorce into a better life. This promise is for parents who suffer for the life a child has chosen to live. God will bring gold out of the fire. This promise is for those who believe God can turn ashes into beauty. This promise is for those who believe their mistakes, sins, a horrible, painful past, can be turn into a blessing to bless others.\n“Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won\u0026rsquo;t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. YOU HAVE TO LOVE. YOU HAVE TO FEEL. IT IS THE REASON YOU ARE HERE ON EARTH. YOU ARE HERE TO RISK YOUR HEART. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.” (\u0026quot;The Painted Drum\u0026quot; by Louise Erdrich)\nThe Bible says that your heavenly Father has a plan for each of our individual lives (FathersLoveLetter.com). To fulfill that plan is nothing less than ultimate success in life. But we need to hear Him, so that He can lead us into His plan for our lives. But to do that, we need to be connected to Him through a personal loving relationship.\nGod loves you with an everlasting love and wants to bless you and fellowship with you!\nBut Christ proved God’s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly! (Romans 5:8, TPT)\nWhy should you care? Well, because deep down you know you are accountable to God because God has placed the desire for love and eternity in every heart.\nGod has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart (Ecc. 3:11, NLT)\nJesus Christ not only loves you and proved it but also claimed to be I AM, the one and only Living God.\n You will never get greater satisfaction that to become a seeker of God\u0026hellip; a seeker of His love\u0026hellip; a seeker of the principles that govern His Kingdom!\n God tells us in Jeremiah 29:13, \u0026ldquo;And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.\u0026rdquo; If you are also a true seeker, if you want to know the true God, then He will reveal himself to you too.\nGod uses all kinds of vessels to reveal His glory — big vessels and little vessels, ornate vessels and plain vessels, very expensive ones and very ordinary ones. They all serve a purpose!\nGod wants to do something great with your life in the near future. Did you know that? He wants to use the \u0026ldquo;Gospel according to Friend\u0026rdquo; and tell people about His power to transform. He wants you to be His story to the people of your world.\nTwo things are required:\n1) Honesty. Own your world. Own the dark part of your life. Stand up and say to yourself: I am responsible for everything I am feeling right now. In the name of Jesus, I will stop blaming people. I will stop victimizing myself. I will ask God to overcome the demonic forces that have been keeping me chained to my past! I will stop feeling shameful, guilty, and I will assume responsibility for everything that happened in my life\u0026hellip; Whether I was guilty or not. Over! New page. New chapter. I got God, the Creator of the universe, on my side!\n2) Surrender your past to God. Everything. Your sins. Your mistakes. Your sins of omission and commission. The people who hurt you. The people you hurt. SURRENDER ALL TO HIM Go ask people forgiveness in the power of God. Dial that number and call. Go knock on a door. Tell people, \u0026ldquo;I am sorry. I hurt you. Would you forgive me? I want to live for God from now on.\u0026rdquo; The bible calls that act, confession. Confession is the act of giving to God all the bad stuff you have done. Confession means asking people forgiveness for sinning against them. Confession gives you a new chapter. Confession means you have nothing to hide. You are a clean vessel. Confession means YOU TRUST GOD!\nAugustine once said, “The confession of bad works is the beginning of good works.” We start by dealing with our past. The Bible says, “If we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do right: he will forgive us our sins and PURIFY us from all our wrongdoing” (1 John 1:9 TEV).\nYOUR CHOICES DETERMINE YOUR POTENTIAL. Here is the key to the best CHOICES of your life: GOD\u0026rsquo;S PURPOSE FOR YOU! I have found out that there are different quality of choices people make. The best quality is born in the soil of people who have CHOSEN God\u0026rsquo;s purpose. Their choices seem to reflect the heart of God. Love and commitment to people above their convenience. Service to others above financial gain. A readiness to stand for God at the expense of popularity. A choice to the fresh revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s will instead of the stale predicaments of irrelevant religion. Whatever you are facing right now, friend, MAKE A CHOICE. Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God\u0026rsquo;s purpose! If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s God\u0026rsquo;s purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one CHOICE that will transform your life forever! And it is not RELIGION! Whatever you are facing right now, friend, MAKE A CHOICE. Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God\u0026rsquo;s purpose! If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s God\u0026rsquo;s purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one CHOICE that will transform your life forever!\n There is nothing the devil wants more than to have disoriented about your destination, confused about your purpose for your life NOW, obsessed with the future, and/or feeling guilty about your PAST life or even yesterday!\n One of the things that I often confront in dealing with people is their inability to define their PURPOSE because of guilt and shame. The devil will do every possible thing to tempt you into something he can later on blame you for. Have you found that out? He uses people to accuse you, to make you feel like to have no right to get up in the name of God, and fulfill your purpose. That attitude is always demonic.\nAnything that distracts your pivotal relationship with God, and your purpose for this life, is demonic and RELIGIOUS!\nHere is the call from Jesus to fulfill your purpose in the next DECADE. Matthew 5: 13-16-The Message\n\u0026ldquo;Let me tell you why you are here. You\u0026rsquo;re here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? You\u0026rsquo;ve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage.\n\u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s another way to put it: You\u0026rsquo;re here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We\u0026rsquo;re going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m going to hide you under a bucket, do you? I\u0026rsquo;m putting you on a light stand. Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand—shine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, you\u0026rsquo;ll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven.\u0026rdquo;\nAsk God to transform your life, (Galatians 5-Fruit of the Spirit-The Message), cleanse you by His GRACE, and then claim your PURPOSE for the next decade.\nBeing salt and a light for God, in this world calls for audacity, commitment, and spiritual strength from Him.\nLet me assure you something: if in the midst of the most chaotic circumstances, you can remember that you have been called by God,\u0026rdquo; you will regain your sense of significance and your will be re-energize! I know it without a doubt! That\u0026rsquo;s what pulled me our of the biggest, most horrible mess of my life.\nLet it sink for a minute: You, yes, you\u0026hellip; You have been called by God to live for Him, with Him, and in behalf of Him in this life!\nHow you face your tests and tribulations will reveal your sense of significance. Do you remember, \u0026ldquo;you have been called by God?\u0026rdquo; This is an important question, because you never know when your life will end. You never know if you will have a chance to \u0026ldquo;succeed\u0026rdquo; at what you set your mind to accomplish. But you can always be certain you are fulfilling your call by God. We are here on this earth, to bring glory to God—to show how to love again, and again\u0026hellip; nothing more, nothing less. The purpose of our lives is to learn how to love. To show others how to love. (Matthew 22: 37-40). The heart of significance is to be able to catch the fact that God has called you to fulfill your purpose, this bringing glory to Him.\nThe only reason why you are here on earth is to learn how to be loved and love again. SIN by Lucifer, Adam and Eve was a relational challenge to the very existential nature of God. You don\u0026rsquo;t fight SIN, you let God love you; you learn to love again! SIN is simply the absence of love.\n"}).add({id:1,href:"/docs/prologue/introduction/",title:"Introduction",description:"Doks is a Hugo theme for building secure, fast, and SEO-ready documentation websites, which you can easily update and customize.",content:"Get started # There are two main ways to get started with Doks:\nTutorial # 👉  The Tutorial is intended for novice to intermediate users.

When God chooses to override your freedom of choice, you are DONE, Friend! God is the supreme manager of the entire universe.\nThere is only one thing I hang on to: and that is the fact that every thing that happens to you as a follower of God, in this life, God promises to use to shape you for eternity! That’s it! I can hold on to this in the midst of darkness. I can hold on to this, when people tell me horrible stories of their past life. People share with me dark secrets of their past. Abuse suffered… They show me the scars on their walls of their hearts. Disillusionment. Shattered dreams. Hopes that will never crystallize in reality. Lives cut short by a tragic accident, cancer or drug overdose. Why? Why? You, see… I don’t know!\n“Before I shaped you in the womb, I KNEW ALL ABOUT YOU. Before you saw the light of day, I had HOLY PLANS FOR YOU” Jeremiah 1:5 (The Message)\n“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.\u0026quot; Jeremiah 29:11-13-NIV\nNo one, on the face of the planet, loves you more than God. No one longs to bless you more than God. Did you know that?\nIt begins with a PROMISE. “I have plans for you.” God always initiate the process of loving. That’s the difference between RELIGION and a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. Religion reminds you of what you need to do to reach up to God. A relationship with God reminds of what He has already done for you. You must respond to His love!\nThen comes YOUR CHOICE. “You will seek me and find me.” He never forces us. We seek Him by choice. And He promises us we will find Him.\nBut, you see, nothing from God is granted to you, to simply enjoy a good life. Every gift from God has a purpose! He calls you to share His blessings with the world.\nThe closer you walk with God, the more you will feel His heartbeat, the more you will begin to see how EVERYTHING is connected even if at the moment it feels intolerable! The tapestry of your life is one that includes your choices, your rejections, your unexpected serendipitous events, other people’s decisions, and God’s intervention and supervision above all things! Nothing escapes God’s vigilant eye.\nYou may not be aware, just now, of the reasons why things happened to you, but the more you cling to God in your personal relationship with Him, the more you will see the connections. And here is the key, you will only understand and trust that God is in control of every detail of your life, as you surrender to Him… As you learn to walk with Him. He will open your eyes… He will give you supernatural wisdom and you will be amazed at God’s grace and magnificent attention to the details of your life!\n“He knows us far better than we know ourselves, knows our pregnant condition, and KEEP US PRESENT BEFORE GOD. That’s why we can be SO SURE THAT EVERY DETAIL in our lives of love for God [Relationship with God] is WORKED into something GOOD.\u0026quot; Romans 8:28-The Message\n“You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good” (Gen. 50:20).\nDo you believe that when you surrender to God, He can use your past, your hurts, your wounds, your enemies, your experiences for your own and others good?\nDo you believe God is managing your for a special purpose? Nothing is an accident, when you give God the control of your life…\nThis is what I know. God is more than a rational, intellectual reality you can grab like a text book, to understand. He is a RELATIONAL God. You can only catch glimpses of Him in a personal relationship with Him. You catch glimpses of God when you read the Bible, when you pray, when He whispers in your mind. What your relationship with God can not satisfy, your mind will never comprehend! Are you with me, Friend? Followers of God in word, without a relationship with Him, are a contradiction in terms. That’s why I often say, it’s easier to become a religious Christian and repeat the lingo, than it is to walk with God, read the Bible, contemplate God, meditate, reflect, and pray for enlightenment! Without a relationship, you do not have depth to grasp the reality of God.\n“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].\u0026quot; —Ephesians 2:10\nIf you are a follower of God, NOTHING IS A MERE ACCIDENT! God is bigger than your circumstances. It may not be fair. It may not be understandable. It may not make sense. But, Friend, God will take whatever happens to you, and turn it around into a blessing!
