We don’t get involved in religious debates. We believe there are enough churches to fulfill that role.\nMy hope with this book is that you give God another chance.

Never Give Up.\n “This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn’t go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. Anyone who trusts in him is acquitted; anyone who refuses to trust him has long since been under the death sentence without knowing it. And why? Because of that person’s failure to believe in the one-of-a-kind Son of God when introduced to him.

You either believe in the supreme, unlimited, power of God or not! You either believe that when you surrender to God, He takes over totally, or you live with a part-time God the rest of your life.\nThe Bible says that your heavenly Father has a plan for each of our individual lives (FathersLoveLetter.com). To fulfill that plan is nothing less than ultimate success in life. But we need to hear Him, so that He can lead us into His plan for our lives. But to do that, we need to be connected to Him through a personal loving relationship.\nGod loves you with an everlasting love and wants to bless you and fellowship with you! But Christ proved God’s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly! (Romans 5:8, TPT)\nWhy should you care? Well, because deep down you know you are accountable to God because God has placed the desire for love and eternity in every heart.\nGod has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart (Ecc. 3:11, NLT)\nJesus Christ not only loves you and proved it but also claimed to be I AM, the one and only Living God.\n You will never get greater satisfaction that to become a seeker of God\u0026hellip; a seeker of His love\u0026hellip; a seeker of the principles that govern His Kingdom!\n God tells us in Jeremiah 29:13, \u0026ldquo;And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.\u0026rdquo; If you are also a true seeker, if you want to know the true God, then He will reveal himself to you too.\n\u0026ldquo;And we know that all things work out for good for those who love God.\u0026rdquo;\nThis promise does not say, that everything in life will be pleasant. This is not an unconditional promise, either. It only applies to followers of God. This promise is for those who believe God is powerful to turn an ugly divorce into a better life. This promise is for parents who suffer for the life a child has chosen to live. God will bring gold out of the fire. This promise is for those who believe God can turn ashes into beauty. This promise is for those who believe their mistakes, sins, a horrible, painful past, can be turn into a blessing to bless others.\nLet your entire life be rooted in God. Question everything with the eyes of one who knows God. Check everything through the filters of God\u0026rsquo;s presence in the here and now. Accept everything in faith, believing that somehow there is a reason for such event. Romans 8:28 holds the key to the best life ever! Nothing in life gets better than trusting in God.\n“Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won\u0026rsquo;t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. YOU HAVE TO LOVE. YOU HAVE TO FEEL. IT IS THE REASON YOU ARE HERE ON EARTH. YOU ARE HERE TO RISK YOUR HEART. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.” (\u0026quot;The Painted Drum\u0026quot; by Louise Erdrich)\n \u0026ldquo;Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. BUT ONE THING I DO: FORGETTING WHAT IS BEHIND AND STRAINING TOWARD WHAT IS AHEAD, I PRESS ON TOWARD the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.\u0026rdquo; Philippians 3:13-14 (NIV)\n Forgetting the PAST, looking FORWARD, I PRESS ON. Can you feel the force behind these words, Friend? Total focus. Total singleness of mind and purpose. Only ONE THING matters: To press on!\nGod uses all kinds of vessels to reveal His glory — big vessels and little vessels, ornate vessels and plain vessels, very expensive ones and very ordinary ones. They all serve a purpose!\nGod wants to do something great with your life in the near future. Did you know that? He wants to use the \u0026ldquo;Gospel according to Friend\u0026rdquo; and tell people about His power to transform. He wants you to be His story to the people of your world.\nTwo things are required:\nHONESTY. Own your world. Own the dark part of your life. Stand up and say to yourself: I am responsible for everything I am feeling right now. In the name of Jesus, I will stop blaming people. I will stop victimizing myself. I will ask God to overcome the demonic forces that have been keeping me chained to my past! I will stop feeling shameful, guilty, and I will assume responsibility for everything that happened in my life\u0026hellip; Whether I was guilty or not. Over! New page. New chapter. I got God, the Creator of the universe, on my side!\nSURRENDER your past to God. Everything. Your sins. Your mistakes. Your sins of omission and commission. The people who hurt you. The people you hurt. SURRENDER ALL TO HIM Go ask people forgiveness in the power of God. Dial that number and call. Go knock on a door. Tell people, \u0026ldquo;I am sorry. I hurt you. Would you forgive me? I want to live for God from now on.\u0026rdquo; The bible calls that act, confession. Confession is the act of giving to God all the bad stuff you have done. Confession means asking people forgiveness for sinning against them. Confession gives you a new chapter. Confession means you have nothing to hide. You are a clean vessel. Confession means YOU TRUST GOD!\nAugustine once said, “The confession of bad works is the beginning of good works.” We start by dealing with our past. The Bible says, “If we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do right: he will forgive us our sins and PURIFY us from all our wrongdoing” (1 John 1:9 TEV).\nYOUR CHOICES DETERMINE YOUR POTENTIAL. Here is the key to the best CHOICES of your life: GOD\u0026rsquo;S PURPOSE FOR YOU! I have found out that there are different quality of choices people make. The best quality is born in the soil of people who have CHOSEN God\u0026rsquo;s purpose. Their choices seem to reflect the heart of God. Love and commitment to people above their convenience. Service to others above financial gain. A readiness to stand for God at the expense of popularity. A choice to the fresh revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s will instead of the stale predicaments of irrelevant religion. Whatever you are facing right now, friend, MAKE A CHOICE. Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God\u0026rsquo;s purpose! If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s God\u0026rsquo;s purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one CHOICE that will transform your life forever! And it is not RELIGION! Whatever you are facing right now, friend, MAKE A CHOICE. Start with one simple choice. That choice will change the direction of your life. Choose God\u0026rsquo;s purpose! If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s God\u0026rsquo;s purpose for your life, write me a note. I will be more than glad to help you find it. That is the one CHOICE that will transform your life forever!\n There is nothing the devil wants more than to have disoriented about your destination, confused about your purpose for your life NOW, obsessed with the future, and/or feeling guilty about your PAST life or even yesterday!\n One of the things that I often confront in dealing with people is their inability to define their PURPOSE because of guilt and shame. The devil will do every possible thing to tempt you into something he can later on blame you for. Have you found that out? He uses people to accuse you, to make you feel like to have no right to get up in the name of God, and fulfill your purpose. That attitude is always demonic.\nAnything that distracts your pivotal relationship with God, and your purpose for this life, is demonic and RELIGIOUS! Here is the call from Jesus to fulfill your purpose in the next DECADE.\n \u0026ldquo;Let me tell you why you are here. You\u0026rsquo;re here to be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? You\u0026rsquo;ve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage. (Matthew 5: 13-16 Message)\n \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s another way to put it: You\u0026rsquo;re here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We\u0026rsquo;re going public with this, as public as a city on a hill. If I make you light-bearers, you don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m going to hide you under a bucket, do you? I\u0026rsquo;m putting you on a light stand. Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand—shine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, you\u0026rsquo;ll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven.\u0026rdquo;\nAsk God to transform your life, (Galatians 5 Fruit of the Spirit), cleanse you by His GRACE, and then claim your PURPOSE for the next decade. Being SALT and a LIGHT for God, in this world calls for audacity, commitment, and spiritual strength from Him.\nLet me assure you something: if in the midst of the most chaotic circumstances, you can remember that you have been called by God,\u0026rdquo; you will regain your sense of significance and your will be re-energize! I know it without a doubt! That\u0026rsquo;s what pulled me our of the biggest, most horrible mess of my life. Let it sink for a minute: You, yes, you\u0026hellip; You have been called by God to live for Him, with Him, and in behalf of Him in this life!\nHow you face your tests and tribulations will reveal your sense of significance. Do you remember, \u0026ldquo;you have been called by God?\u0026rdquo; This is an important question, because you never know when your life will end. You never know if you will have a chance to \u0026ldquo;succeed\u0026rdquo; at what you set your mind to accomplish. But you can always be certain you are fulfilling your call by God. We are here on this earth, to bring glory to God—to show how to love again, and again\u0026hellip; nothing more, nothing less. The purpose of our lives is to learn how to love. To show others how to love. (Matthew 22: 37-40). The heart of significance is to be able to catch the fact that God has called you to fulfill your purpose, this bringing glory to Him.\nThe only reason why you are here on earth is to learn how to be loved and love again. SIN by Lucifer, Adam and Eve was a relational challenge to the very existential nature of God. You don\u0026rsquo;t fight SIN, you let God love you; you learn to love again! SIN is simply the absence of love.\nGod is Shaping You For Eternity # There is only one thing I hang on to: and that is the fact that every thing that happens to you as a follower of God, in this life, God promises to use to shape you for eternity! That\u0026rsquo;s it! I can hold on to this in the midst of darkness. I can hold on to this, when people tell me horrible stories of their past life. People share with me dark secrets of their past. Abuse suffered\u0026hellip; They show me the scars on their walls of their hearts. Disillusionment. Shattered dreams. Hopes that will never crystallize in reality. Lives cut short by a tragic accident, cancer or drug overdose. Why? Why? You, see\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know!\nThis is what I know. God is more than a rational, intellectual reality you can grab like a text book, to understand. He is a RELATIONAL God. You can only catch glimpses of Him in a personal relationship with Him. You catch glimpses of God when you read the Bible, when you pray, when He whispers in your mind. What your relationship with God can not satisfy, your mind will never comprehend! Are you with me, Friend? Followers of God in word, without a relationship with Him, are a contradiction in terms. That\u0026rsquo;s why I often say, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to become a religious Christian and repeat the lingo, than it is to walk with God, read the Bible, contemplate God, meditate, reflect, and pray for enlightenment! Without a relationship, you do not have depth to grasp the reality of God.\nGod Is Preparing You Today For Something Greater Tomorrow!\nIf you were to ask Moses how he became who he was, he would remind you of his trials with Pharaoh and his times of testing in the wilderness. If you were to ask Joseph, he would most likely refer back to his years as a slave, his imprisonment on a false accusation, and his imprisonment in Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s dungeon. Talk to Peter, and he would probably point back to his denial and how he learned many difficult yet important lessons.\nMaybe you find yourself facing something similar in your life today. Maybe you are beyond shock at something that just happened to you. \u0026ldquo;Why me? Why me?\u0026rdquo; There may be no rational interpretation of what is happening to you. But, then, I know one thing and one thing only: God is preparing you for a choice work. God is shaping you for eternity. When you follow God, no bad experience goes to waste. No storm is useless. You become more understanding. You learn to depend on God more than before. You begin to see what\u0026rsquo;s relevant in this life. You grow roots deeper in the heart of God!\n\u0026ldquo;For we are God\u0026rsquo;s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].\u0026rdquo; —Ephesians 2:10\nIf you are a follower of God, Friend, NOTHING IS A MERE ACCIDENT! God is bigger than your circumstances. It may not be fair. It may not be understandable. It may not make sense. But, Friend, God will take whatever happens to you, and turn it around into a blessing! Romans 8:28\nWalk with God today, in the silence of your heart, knowing He is shaping you for eternity.\nThe Real Test of Holiness #  C. S. Lewis said, \u0026ldquo;The real test of being in the presence of God is that you either forget about yourself altogether or see yourself as a small, dirty object.\u0026rdquo;\n We don\u0026rsquo;t often hear statements like that coming from pulpits or worship center\u0026rsquo;s podiums today. We hear how we can all be champions. We hear how we can all be successful, victorious. We hear how much prosperity faithfulness to God can bring into our lives. It seems to me like in many ways, it is not cool to speak of being spiritually destitute, to teach that we are to be poor in spirit. Yet the Bible says, \u0026ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 5:3). We should be praising God for people who feel empty\u0026hellip; people who need direction and God in their lives. We should rejoice when someone says to us, \u0026ldquo;You know, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what else to do with my marriage\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Wow! \u0026ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Anything that brings us to our knees in humble humility and praying to God for help is a \u0026ldquo;blessed\u0026rdquo; moment Jesus, said. \u0026ldquo;Blessed\u0026rdquo; is the person who experiences \u0026ldquo;poverty of spirit.\u0026rdquo;\nLast time I read the Gospels, the \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; were not being invited to have fun\u0026hellip; or invited to study a map, or a calendar of last day events! They were being invited because they were \u0026ldquo;lost.\u0026rdquo; THEY WERE BEING INVITED TO A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO RESCUE LOST PEOPLE\u0026quot;\n Lostness is a serious condition, friend. I am not against fun, joy and a good laugh. But you see, if you are lost, if you acknowledge your condition, when you meet God, you will either run to Him for help, embrace Him and love Him, or you will run away from Him!\n Jesus told a story about a Pharisee and a sinner who went into the temple to pray.\nThe Pharisee, a religious man, prayed, \u0026ldquo;God, I thank You that I am not like other men . . .\u0026rdquo; (Luke 18:11). You see, this was the kind of guy that had RELIGION all figured out. His God has options for everything! His God could be explained by rules, laws, decrees, teachings and doctrine. He was basically saying, \u0026ldquo;I have the TRUTH, I follow the TRUTH, and I got it!\u0026rdquo; Wow! Would you love to leave your Lamborghini parked in his guy\u0026rsquo;s garage? He is the typically good guy. Dependable, predictable, hard worker, efficient, a man of his word. This guy would the the leader of the local church and most likely the main source of financial support. A dream church member!\nThe sinner, on the other hand, WAS LOST. He wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even lift up his eyes. He beat on his chest and said, \u0026ldquo;God, be merciful to me a sinner!\u0026rdquo; (verse 13), or more literally, \u0026ldquo;the sinner.\u0026rdquo; Apparently he did not think of himself as one sinner among many; he acted as though he were the only one. He was so overwhelmed with the sense of his sin, his moral bankruptcy, and his spiritual destitution that, as far as he was concerned, everyone else\u0026rsquo;s sin paled in comparison.\nJesus said of the SINNER, \u0026ldquo;This man went down to his house justified rather than the other . . .\u0026rdquo; (verse 14). Why? Because he saw himself as he really was. Yet we tend do the very opposite. We attempt to justify our sin because we can always find others who are far worse.\nAre you the \u0026ldquo;good guy\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;sinner.\u0026rdquo;\nAre you the one who has the answers, or are you a seeker after the transforming power of God in your life?\nAre you into being a \u0026ldquo;good person\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;holy\u0026rdquo;?\nHow do you feel about yourself in the presence of God?\nDoes God make you \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;holy\u0026rdquo;?\nIf you want to be HOLY for God, if you want to LIVE, really LIVE God\u0026rsquo;s life (John 10:10), experience the MOST PHENOMENAL RADICAL POWER OF GOD in the next 10 years, then you must see yourself as you are, be sorry for it, and want to see CHANGE in your life. Seek God as a \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; person and you will FIND HIM!\n\u0026ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 5:3)\n\u0026ldquo;For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\u0026rdquo; Luke 18:14 (This was the verse that God repeated in my head 101 times when I was considering suicide in the darkest hour of my life. I recalled my Dad\u0026rsquo;s voice repeating this verse to me\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Humble yourself\u0026hellip; He will exalt you!\u0026rdquo; And today, 4 years later I can tell you that God fulfilled that promise in my life like I have never known ever before.)\nSpiritual poverty is a GODLY virtue! It is the TEST OF HOLINESS\nSeekers of God bring a smile to the face of God. People who are passionate about God, His Word, praying and seeking His will are the only ones who find TRUE, ultimate satisfaction. The test of HOLINESS is very simple: \u0026ldquo;How much do you long for God in your life?\u0026rdquo; Then show it! Seek Him. Read your Bible every day. Pray. Meditate.\nThe more you follow God, the more you will become like Him. Why? Because the Spirit of God is always shaping you into the likeness of Jesus. Why? Because one day you will be living in heaven, a perfect place for people who have been perfected by God! In the book of Acts, we read that the religious leaders, when they saw Peter and John\u0026rsquo;s boldness, realized \u0026ldquo;they had been with Jesus\u0026rdquo; (Acts 4:13). It overflowed from their lives. We can try to imitate Jesus, but that is not good enough. We become like Him through \u0026ldquo;impartation\u0026rdquo;—which is the Spirit of God living with you. As you walk with Him, live with Him, learn to hear His voice, you become more and more like Jesus. You find yourself thinking like Jesus. You begin to react like Jesus. Compassion for the poor and the disadvantaged is born in your heart. I have found myself in dialogue with myself sometimes saying, \u0026ldquo;This was not me, 15 years ago?\u0026rdquo; But you see, as I faced my own homelessness, my own dark moments, my own imperfection, the Spirit of God was right there transforming me, and reminding me, that the purpose of that experience, is to learn how to be compassionate towards others who face the same.\nPaul wrote, \u0026ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ; IT IS NO LONGER I WHO LIVE, but CHRIST LIVES IN ME; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me\u0026rdquo; (Galatians 2:20).\nIn the first century, the word \u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo; was a term of derision that meant \u0026ldquo;of the party of Christ.\u0026rdquo; Are you a Christian because people see Christ in you, Friend? Are you His follower? That is God\u0026rsquo;s plan for your life: to make you like Christ.\nPain and Pleasure # All human behavior moves in a pendulum like motion I call the \u0026ldquo;PP\u0026rdquo; principle. \u0026ldquo;PP\u0026rdquo; stands for Pain and Pleasure. We run away from pain towards pleasure in everything we do. We begin on the \u0026ldquo;PP\u0026rdquo; path instinctively, from the time we are born, before we develop consciousness. Hunger is pain, seeking pleasure or fulfillment. Because this world is imperfect, we inevitably move from pleasure back to pain, and back to seeking pleasure. Even those who choose sado-masochistic modes of behavior, are secretly seeking pleasure, though most of us may not understand it as such. I have found out, after years of observing human conduct, that at the root of even the most bizarre and destructive behavior, there is a twisted, hidden hope to find pleasure, or at least a way to minimize pain.

To learn HOW to love God. To learn HOW to love people. To learn HOW to love self.  \u0026ldquo;Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo;LOVE the Lord your God with all your passion and prayer and intelligence.\u0026rsquo; This is the most important, the first on any list.

Whatever is not motivated by LOVE has \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; value in the eyes of God. Did you know that? And obeying God\u0026rsquo;s LAW OF LOVE is not legalistic either! It\u0026rsquo;s about LOVE!

If I give everything I own to the poor and even go to the stake to be burned as a martyr, but I don\u0026rsquo;t love, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten nowhere. So, no matter what I say, what I believe, and what I do, I\u0026rsquo;m bankrupt without love.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 13:1-4 The Message)\nEverything God does in His universe is to LOVE you, bless you and direct you.

To understand God we must study Jesus!\nGod is not just the Creator of all things, but He also has the power to manage it ALL!. He sees it all. He knows it all.

The fear of loosing your salvation is a sign of religion in your life. That is not from God! The anxiety for being right is perfectionism, but it\u0026rsquo;s not from God! The drive to be moral, ethical, is perfectionism, but it\u0026rsquo;s not from God! God makes people \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; differently than religion, culture, society and ethics! God changes the heart his way, in his own time! BEHAVIOR in God\u0026rsquo;s universe follows NEW BIRTH. Transformation is the work of the Holy Spirit.

It does not allow you to do whatever you want. It simply means that beyond your own human wisdom, failures, darkness, difficult moments and painful occurrences, THERE IS GOD! In control of your destiny. God working out His master plan for your life on this earth.\nThis is the distinctive mark between followers of God and non followers! You can be religious, and have it all figure it out, but you will not be a follower of God, without this reality in your life!\nGod is with you! God walks with you! God will never drop you! No one, no one, can ever even touch you without God\u0026rsquo;s consent! Read Romans 8! Let the Word of God transform your life right now!\nJesus Died to Destroy the Hostility Between Races # Jesus Christ has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. (Ephesians 2:14-16)\nThe suspicion, prejudice, and demeaning attitudes between Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews) in New Testament times was as serious as the racial, ethnic, and national hostilities in our day. One example of the antagonism is what happened in Antioch between Cephas (sometimes called Peter) and Paul. Paul recounts the story: \u0026ldquo;When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party\u0026rdquo; (Galatians 2:11-12). Peter had been living in the freedom of Jesus Christ. In spite of the fact that he was a Jewish Christian, he was eating with non-Jewish Christians. The dividing wall had come down. The hostility had been overcome. This is what Christ died to achieve. But then some very conservative Jews came to Antioch. Cephas panicked. He feared their criticism. So he pulled back from his fellowship with Gentiles. The apostle Paul saw this happening. What would he do? Serve the status quo? Keep peace between the visiting conservatives and the more free Christian Jews in Antioch? The key to Paul’s behavior is found in these words: \u0026ldquo;I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel\u0026rdquo; (Galatians 2:14). This is a crucial statement. Racial and ethnic segregation is a gospel issue! Cephas’ fear and withdrawal from fellowship across ethnic lines was \u0026ldquo;not in step with the truth of the gospel.\u0026rdquo; Christ had died to tear down this wall. And Cephas was building it up again. So Paul did not serve the status quo, and he did not maintain a gospel-denying peace. He confronted Cephas publicly. \u0026ldquo;I said to Cephas before them all, ‘If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile (non-Jew) and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?’\u0026rdquo; (Galatians 2:14). In other words, Cephas’ withdrawal from fellowship with non-Jewish Christians communicated a deadly message: You must become like Jews to be fully acceptable. This was the very thing that Christ died to abolish. Jesus died to create a whole new way for races to be reconciled. Ritual and race are not the ground of joyful togetherness. Christ is. He fulfilled the law perfectly. All the aspects of it that separated people ended in him—except one: the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nIt is impossible to build a lasting unity among races by saying that all religions can come together as equally valid. Jesus Christ is the Son of God. God sent him into the world as the one and only means of saving sinners and reconciling races forever. If we deny this, we undermine the very foundation of eternal hope and everlasting unity among peoples. By his death on the cross, something cosmic, not parochial, was accomplished. God and man were reconciled. Only as the races find and enjoy this will they love and enjoy each other forever. In overcoming our alienation from God, Christ overcomes it between races. - Source: Fifty Reasons Why Jesus Came to Die by John Piper\nYour True Identity in Christ # Extraordinary people don\u0026rsquo;t just happen. Ordinary people do happen.\nBeautiful people are never accidents! Gorgeous and handsome people may just have the right DNA. That\u0026rsquo;s not what changes the world.\nCompassionate people are not produced from one day to another. It often takes a life of pain and suffering. Efficient, productive, motivated, and cold blooded people may succeed in what they pursue but will never leave behind an inspiring legacy for the next generation.\nHow you deal with your crisis, your challenge, your point of suffering, will ultimately determine how beautiful, how compassionate, how extraordinary you will become.\nThe ones who run away from trouble end up empty, very often alone, and no standing values others can follow. The crafting of one\u0026rsquo;s character takes a relationship with God, time, commitment, and very often untold suffering.\n“The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.” ~ Elisabeth Kübler-Ross\nDo you want to be average? Stay on the planes, and enjoy the good life. Do you want to be extraordinary? Climb up the mountain of challenges facing you. Stick to your marriage. Keep loving the unloving. Keep looking for ways to serve others. Don\u0026rsquo;t settle for money and comfort.

The more the \u0026ldquo;ego\u0026rdquo; attempts to control the \u0026ldquo;shadow\u0026rdquo; the more \u0026ldquo;neurosis\u0026rdquo; will be a part of such personality.\nCultural mores, religion, and morality are collective ways to control what is considered evil. \u0026ldquo;Ego\u0026rdquo; is the force which keeps things in \u0026ldquo;order,\u0026rdquo; thus walking further and further away from \u0026ldquo;wholeness.\u0026rdquo; A relationship with God reverses the direction of the process.\nCarl G. Jung said, \u0026ldquo;An inflated consciousness is always egocentric and conscious of nothing but its own existence. [selfish] It is incapable of learning from the past, incapable of understanding contemporary events, and incapable of drawing right conclusions about the future. It is hypnotized by itself and therefore cannot be argued with. It inevitably dooms itself to calamities that must strike it dead.\u0026rdquo; (Carl G. Jung, 1944. CW 12.p. 563)\nJulian of Norwich experienced her “showings,” as she called them, on the night of May 8, 1373. Then she lived in the same room for twenty years, trying to process and communicate what she had experienced on that one night. Julian wrote about those \u0026ldquo;showings\u0026rdquo; (or revelations) in her book \u0026ldquo;Revelations of Divine Love,\u0026rdquo; which happened to be the first book published in English by a woman! Fascinating! experienced and wrote of a compassionate, RELATIONAL, and joyful God. All mystics tend to speak of a relationship with God instead of religion. She writes: “For before he (God) made us, he loved us; and when we were made, we loved him. And THIS IS OUR SUBSTANTIAL GOODNESS, the substantial goodness in us of the Holy Spirit. It is nothing we create; it is our substance. God revealed to me that there may and there will be nothing at all between God and the soul. And in this endless love, the human soul is kept whole as all the matter of creation is kept whole.”\nHere is the most fascinating aspect of Julian\u0026rsquo;s writing regarding her \u0026ldquo;showings\u0026rdquo; or revelations. She uses the Middle English word “oneing” to describe this whole-making work of God, which is what I describe as the journey towards wholeness.\nDid you know God is always \u0026ldquo;oneing everything\u0026rdquo;? He is always bringing lose ends together. God is always mending broken relationships. God is forever taking the broken pieces and \u0026ldquo;oneing\u0026rdquo; them in a sacred task of wholism. God makes twos, and threes, (trinities), and fours, and divisions, and dichotomies, and inconsistencies, and polarities, and dualisms, INTO ONE.\nAs Julian herself explains, [My explanations] “God wants us to know that this beloved soul [unity] that we are, is preciously knitted to him in its making by a knot so subtle and so mighty that it is \u0026ldquo;oned\u0026rdquo; [united, made one] with God. In this \u0026ldquo;oneing\u0026rdquo; it is made endlessly holy.\u0026quot; [Noticed, that holy, health, whole, all come from the same root word: complete, harmonious, integrated, one]. \u0026ldquo;Furthermore,\u0026rdquo; Julian says, \u0026ldquo;he [God] wants us to know that all the souls [people] which are one day to be saved in heaven without end are knit in this same knot and united in this same union, and made holy in this one identical holiness.” Profound statements!\nThe Apostle Paul speaks of this journey from \u0026ldquo;ego\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;wholeness,\u0026rdquo; what Julian called \u0026ldquo;oneing,\u0026rdquo; in a magnificent chapter of the book to the Ephesians. I will only quote excerpts of chapter 4 (The Message). It\u0026rsquo;s a magnificent chapter!\n\u0026ldquo;In light of all this, here’s what I want you to do. While I’m locked up here, a prisoner for the Master, I want you to get out there and walk—better yet, run!—on the road God called you to travel. I don’t want any of you sitting around on your hands. I don’t want anyone strolling off, down some path that goes nowhere. And mark that you do this with humility and discipline—not in fits and starts, but steadily, pouring yourselves out for each other in acts of love, alert at noticing differences and quick at mending fences. [Notice the emphasis: moving from \u0026ldquo;ego\u0026rdquo; (self) to \u0026ldquo;wholeness,\u0026rdquo; community and harmony]\n\u0026ldquo;You were all called to travel on the same road and in the same direction, so stay together, both outwardly and inwardly.\nYou have ONE Master, ONE faith, ONE baptism, ONE God and Father of ALL, who rules over ALL, works through ALL, and is present in ALL. EVERYTHING you are and think and do is PERMEATED WITH ONENESS. [Wholeness]\n\u0026ldquo;But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should all look and speak and act the same. Out of the generosity of Christ, each of us is given his own gift.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He handed out gifts above and below, filled heaven with his gifts, filled earth with his gifts. He handed out gifts of apostle, prophet, evangelist, and pastor-teacher to train Christ’s followers in skilled servant work, working within Christ’s body, THE CHURCH, UNTIL we’re ALL moving rhythmically and easily with each other, efficient and graceful in response to God’s Son, fully mature adults, fully developed within and without, fully alive like Christ.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;God wants us to grow up, to know the WHOLE truth and tell it in LOVE—like Christ in everything. We take our lead from Christ, who is the source of everything we do. He keeps us in step with each other. His very breath and blood flow through us, nourishing us so that we will grow up HEALTHY in God, robust in LOVE.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And so I insist—and God backs me up on this—that there be no going along with the crowd, the empty-headed, mindless crowd. They’ve refused for so long to deal with God that they’ve lost touch not only with God but with reality itself. They can’t think straight anymore. Feeling no pain, [no shame, no guilt] they let themselves go in sexual obsession, addicted to every sort of perversion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But that’s no life for you. You learned Christ! Since, then, we do not have the excuse of ignorance, everything—and I do mean everything—connected with that old way of life has to go. It’s rotten through and through. Get rid of it! And then take on an entirely NEW WAY OF LIFE—a God-fashioned life, a life renewed from the inside and working itself into your conduct as God accurately reproduces his character in you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What this adds up to, then, is this: no more lies, no more pretense. Tell your neighbor the truth. In Christ’s body WE\u0026rsquo;RE ALL CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER, after all. When you lie to others, you end up lying to yourself.\u0026rdquo; [The Apostle Paul goes back and forth from \u0026ldquo;Ego\u0026rdquo; (Sinful, fragmented way, to wholeness, God\u0026rsquo;s way!]\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead and be angry. You do well to be angry—but don’t use your anger as fuel for revenge. And don’t stay angry. Don’t go to bed angry.

When God chooses to override your freedom of choice, you are DONE, Friend! God is the supreme manager of the entire universe.\nYou are Created For Significance Your browser does not support the audio element.   There is only one thing I hang on to: and that is the fact that every thing that happens to you as a follower of God, in this life, God promises to use to shape you for eternity! That’s it! I can hold on to this in the midst of darkness. I can hold on to this, when people tell me horrible stories of their past life. People share with me dark secrets of their past. Abuse suffered… They show me the scars on their walls of their hearts. Disillusionment. Shattered dreams. Hopes that will never crystallize in reality. Lives cut short by a tragic accident, cancer or drug overdose. Why? Why? You, see… I don’t know!\n“Before I shaped you in the womb, I KNEW ALL ABOUT YOU. Before you saw the light of day, I had HOLY PLANS FOR YOU” (Jeremiah 1:5 The Message)\n“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.\u0026quot; (Jeremiah 29:11-13 NIV)\nNo one, on the face of the planet, loves you more than God. No one longs to bless you more than God. Did you know that?\nIt begins with a PROMISE. “I have plans for you.” God always initiate the process of loving. That’s the difference between RELIGION and a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. Religion reminds you of what you need to do to reach up to God. A relationship with God reminds of what He has already done for you. You must respond to His love!\nThen comes YOUR CHOICE. “You will seek me and find me.” He never forces us. We seek Him by choice. And He promises us we will find Him.\nBut, you see, nothing from God is granted to you, to simply enjoy a good life. Every gift from God has a purpose! He calls you to share His blessings with the world.\nThe closer you walk with God, the more you will feel His heartbeat, the more you will begin to see how EVERYTHING is connected even if at the moment it feels intolerable! The tapestry of your life is one that includes your choices, your rejections, your unexpected serendipitous events, other people’s decisions, and God’s intervention and supervision above all things! Nothing escapes God’s vigilant eye.\nYou may not be aware, just now, of the reasons why things happened to you, but the more you cling to God in your personal relationship with Him, the more you will see the connections. And here is the key, you will only understand and trust that God is in control of every detail of your life, as you surrender to Him… As you learn to walk with Him. He will open your eyes… He will give you supernatural wisdom and you will be amazed at God’s grace and magnificent attention to the details of your life!\n“He knows us far better than we know ourselves, knows our pregnant condition, and KEEP US PRESENT BEFORE GOD. That’s why we can be SO SURE THAT EVERY DETAIL in our lives of love for God [Relationship with God] is WORKED into something GOOD.\u0026quot; (Romans 8:28 The Message)\n“You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good” (Gen. 50:20).\nDo you believe that when you surrender to God, He can use your past, your hurts, your wounds, your enemies, your experiences for your own and others good? Do you believe God is managing your for a special purpose? Nothing is an accident, when you give God the control of your life\u0026hellip;\nThis is what I know. God is more than a rational, intellectual reality you can grab like a text book, to understand. He is a RELATIONAL God. You can only catch glimpses of Him in a personal relationship with Him. You catch glimpses of God when you read the Bible, when you pray, when He whispers in your mind. What your relationship with God can not satisfy, your mind will never comprehend! Are you with me, Friend? Followers of God in word, without a relationship with Him, are a contradiction in terms. That’s why I often say, it’s easier to become a religious Christian and repeat the lingo, than it is to walk with God, read the Bible, contemplate God, meditate, reflect, and pray for enlightenment! Without a relationship, you do not have depth to grasp the reality of God.\n“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].\u0026quot; (Ephesians 2:10)\nIf you are a follower of God, NOTHING IS A MERE ACCIDENT! God is bigger than your circumstances. It may not be fair. It may not be understandable. It may not make sense. But God will take whatever happens to you, and turn it around into a blessing! (Romans 8:28)\n"}).add({id:4,href:"/docs/book/power-of-belief/",title:"Power of Belief",description:"When Jesus was crucified, it was an enormous shock to His followers.

They secretly expected Him to establish His kingdom on earth when pushed against the wall! They saw how Jesus was mistreated. To the last moment, they waited for a divine manifestation of power to take care of Jesus, and prove to the world He was indeed the Messiah, the liberator of the Jewish nation. They figured out that if Jesus was able to heal the sick, provide food to crowds out of nothing, wine out of water, He could also perform a miracle in His behalf! But instead, He was beaten, spit on, ridiculed, and hung on a Roman cross. They heard with their own ears Jesus\u0026rsquo; words, “It is finished.” Then they watched Him die before their very eyes. They went back home on that Friday evening thinking it was OVER! It was good as it lasted.\nThe power of God is manifested upon those who BELIEVE. Doubt is deadly to your relationship with God. Believing begins with gratefulness. You will never believe God with all your heart if you are not grateful for what He is doing in your life, now. It’s your attitude, not your aptitude, that will give you altitude. Gratefulness is a transforming attitude. Why would you believe in God, if you feel negative about your life? If you don’t see anything to be grateful for? Believing is rooted in gratefulness. Perhaps, you need to ask God to change your eyes, your mind, to see how He is blessing you in the midst of adverse circumstances. Gratitude is a spiritual powerful habit. From gratitude you will move to joy, to worship, to adoration… and TO BELIEVING in the power and the love of God.\nShift Your Mindset # Your thoughts shape your reality.\nWhenever you think you can achieve something or whenever you think you will never be able to, you are right in both instances. When you decide that you are useless that’s all you’ll ever be. But if you choose to believe you were meant for greatness, most likely you will be driven to look for resources that will assist in becoming what you chose to be.\nHow you feel about yourself is what you project into the world and although your thoughts cannot be seen, they can be felt by others. If you see yourself as ugly or unfit that’s exactly how others will perceive you too.\nYour thoughts will either generate positive energy or negative energy. If positive, you will attract people towards you. If you generate negative energy rooted in a negative thoughts, you will push people away.\nYour emotional state doesn\u0026rsquo;t just affect the ones who surround you but it drastically affects your own quality of life. What you believe to be true about yourself will always remain so unless you choose to change your thoughts! I do meet people who tell me, \u0026ldquo;change is impossible at this age. Or, people don\u0026rsquo;t really change! Well, if you have those thoughts, guess what? You won\u0026rsquo;t change!\nEverything starts with a thought! At the end of the day you are what you think about!\nI read my Bible in the morning and seek God\u0026rsquo;s presence not because I think I am better than anyone else. I just know I need positive thoughts from God to live life one more day! This morning just in the middle of my devotional time with God, He shared a couple of ideas. I write them down on paper. They gave me the \u0026ldquo;oxygen\u0026rdquo; I needed to breath well all day long. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing what good, positive, healthy, dynamic thoughts can do for you.\nPositive thoughts do not only bless you personally, physically, emotionally, but they create a positive presence in your mind that influence all your interactions with people.\n You feel what you think! You do what you think! Research shows that 85% of physical illness and health is caused by emotions. What are emotions? We spoke about this last night. Emotions and feelings are deeper, non rational thoughts, rooted in the body, in your gut, in your tummy! The gut has often been called the second brain.\n It turns out that both our gut and our brain originate early in embryogenesis from the same clump of tissue which divides during fetal development. While one section turns into the central nervous system, another piece migrates to become the enteric nervous system. Later the two nervous systems connect via a cable called the vagus nerve \u0026ndash; the longest of all the cranial nerves whose name is derived from Latin, meaning \u0026ldquo;wandering.\u0026rdquo; The vagus nerve meanders from the brain stem through the neck and finally ends up in the abdomen. There\u0026rsquo;s the brain-gut connection.\nNow we know that the brain is not the only place in the body that\u0026rsquo;s full of neurotransmitters. A hundred million neurotransmitters line the length of the gut, approximately the same number that is found in the brain. If we add the nerve cells of the esophagus, stomach and large intestine, there are more nerve cells in the gut than there are in the entire remainder of the peripheral nervous system. Nearly every chemical that controls the brain in the head has been identified in the gut, including hormones and neurotransmitters.\nWhy Am I sharing this with you? Because most of your life is driven by \u0026ldquo;thoughts\u0026rdquo; that you are not always able to describe with words. We call them \u0026ldquo;feelings and emotions\u0026rdquo; but in reality they are \u0026ldquo;thoughts.\u0026rdquo;\n God wants to impact your brain (and your second brain), with His spiritual power and His views of the world you perceive and experience.\n Today, I decided to share with you what I use with clients I coach, and in my own personal walk with God.\nIf you want to unleash the power of God in your life, your brain (both brains) must be aligned with God! If you want to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco you must drive North! If you choose the 10 Fwy going east you will end up in Tucson, Arizona. Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me you are shocked when you end up in Tucson! :-) Same is true with God! Do you want to experience the transforming power of God in your life? Do you want to experience the fruit of the Spirit? (Galatians 5) Then, go North, not East, nor South, nor West! Makes sens, uh?\nHere are the 3 simple steps to shift from your natural tendency, from self, to God in order to experience His POWER.\n Surrender to God! Yes, surrender! No \u0026ldquo;Life Coach,\u0026rdquo; no motivational coach, no therapist will tell you this upfront. I do! Nothing else works, except temporarily! I believe God is the source of transformational power. Strategies are fine! Principles and steps are fine! But ultimately it all comes down to POWER. Take your struggle to God. Visualize the act of giving to God your pain, your suffering, your wounds, your conflict, your marriage, your relationship, your sense of emptiness.  Jesus said in Matthew 11: 28-30 (The Message)\n \u0026ldquo;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you\u0026rsquo;ll recover your life. I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won\u0026rsquo;t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you\u0026rsquo;ll learn to live freely and lightly.\u0026rdquo;\n Fear and anxiety come from your gut! From your second brain! Memories from the past. Hurts, wounds, anger, resentment. These are all \u0026ldquo;thoughts\u0026rdquo; dressed up as feelings!\n2 Corinthians 10:5 (NIV)\n\u0026ldquo;We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we TAKE EVERY THOUGHT TO MAKE IT OBEDIENT TO CHRIST.\u0026rdquo;\nGod says, bring it all to me. Make every thought obey your choice! Make them go NORTH! :-) It is so counter-intuitive to what we humans do! You want to experience the unleashing of God\u0026rsquo;s power in your life? SHIFT from self, from feelings and emotions, from what obsesses you, from the circumstances you are facing, to a state of surrendering to God! Stop fighting! Surrender to God!\nListen to God! If you surrender to God whatever troubles you, and move back into the noise of life, you will never hear God\u0026rsquo;s voice! You must commit to hearing God speak to you. Listen to and read your Bible, meditate, wait in silence, be on the alert\u0026hellip; God will speak. God will give you direction. God will not leave you alone. Devotional books are OK to hear God speaks, but NOTHING WILL SUBSTITUTE THE DIRECT READING OF THE LIVING WORD OF GOD, THE BIBLE. Whatever you fill your brain with, will ultimately be the voice you will hear back! Fill your mind with God\u0026rsquo;s Word, and you will hear God\u0026rsquo;s voice!  Jeremiah was an angry prophet of God in the Old Testament. He was so angry with God that he wrote an entire book of complaints against God. Imagine! The book is called \u0026ldquo;Lamentations.\u0026rdquo; One of the principles Jeremiah shares with us in the midst of his anger and frustration is this:\nLamentations 3: 25-33 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;God proves to be good to the man who passionately WAITS, to the woman who diligently SEEKS. It\u0026rsquo;s a good thing to quietly hope, quietly hope for help from God.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When life is heavy and hard to take, go off by yourself. ENTER THE SILENCE. BOW IN PRAYER. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask questions: WAIT for hope to appear. Don\u0026rsquo;t run from trouble. Take it full-face. The \u0026ldquo;worst\u0026rdquo; is never the worst.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why? Because the Master [God] won\u0026rsquo;t ever walk out and fail to return. If he works severely, he also works tenderly. His stockpiles of loyal love are immense. He takes no pleasure in making life hard,in throwing roadblocks in the way.\u0026rdquo;\nGod will speak to you, if you stop to listen. He may give you another perspective on what is going on. (Romans 8:28) Part of the SHIFT we spoke about last night is the ability to hear God! Do you want to experience the unleashing of God\u0026rsquo;s power in your life? STOP AND LISTEN! God is longing to share His purpose for your life!\nPraise God in the midst of adversity. Cultivate the fine art of gratefulness. It must be cultivated and practiced to become second nature! Some of my homeless brothers and sisters have taught me this art the best! One of the best weapons to destroy and overcome negativity is reverse psychology. Praise God when you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it! Find positive in the midst of adverse conditions. It just takes some creativity. Praise God even when physical reality defies your gratefulness. When you lose your job, when you are sick, when someone betrays you and stabs you in the back, praise God! Take it as an opportunity to pray for that person. In the midst of grieving a loved one, it is possible to rejoice in God, knowing that ultimately He will make things come around right, even when you cannot see it in the present.  Praising God, expressing gratefulness to God in the midst of adversity places you at a much higher level of consciousness. You are allowing God to fill you with hope, love and prepare you to see what you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see in a state of negativity. Gratefulness, purposeful love, healthy food, and exercise are the four basics of a healthy brain!\n1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;Be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; THANK GOD NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. This is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live.\u0026rdquo;\nDo you want to experience the unleashing of God\u0026rsquo;s power in your life? SHIFT your mind! SHIFT towards God!\n  Surrender\n  Listen\n  Praise\n  Dealing with Negativity # We all deal with negative emotions at one time or another. We may be having a \u0026ldquo;bad hair day,\u0026rdquo; we may meet someone that really irritates us, we may get hurt, ignored, or mistreated by someone. Some of us carry those negative emotions all the time because they have been buried so deep in our psyche that they almost totally shape our sense of identity.\nWhat Are Negative Emotions?\nI want you to think of emotions as ENERGY. That\u0026rsquo;s what they are! The emotions (energy) can be positive or negative.\n Principle # 1. POSITIVE EMOTIONS are nearly the same as NEGATIVE ONES.  If you are experiencing frustration and you are able to strip away the circumstances that caused the frustration, the RAW ENERGY of frustration feels a lot like enthusiasm. Are you with me, Friend? Think about it: frustration and enthusiasm are the same raw, primal energy (car) going in two opposite directions, negative which is frustration (north) or positive which is enthusiasm (south).\nIf you are experiencing intense feelings of anger/hostility and you are able to strip away the circumstances that caused the feelings of anger/hostility the RAW ENERGY feels a lot like passionate love. Have you heard of angry couples who make love like crazy after a very bad fight? Why is that? The same raw, primal energy can go in two different directions (north or south); negative or positive. Passion can serve the purpose of LOVE which will create intense bonding, or HATE, which will will destroy the relationship. By the way, love making after a fight is a bad idea if one or both spouses are into denial and NOT resolving conflict. Great idea, if you are good at conflict resolution! (You would be surprised how much I learn listening to marriages. Better than reading novels, watching any movie, or a reality show\u0026hellip; :-)\nHere is the bottom line of this principle. When you\u0026rsquo;re feeling negative, you\u0026rsquo;re actually quite close to feeling positive. Let me help you imagine this picture so you will understand the next step. The moment you are able to identify negative energy and toxicity in yourself, remember, (see it with your mind) you are just one step away from experiencing positive and healing energy! Have you ever dealt with negative and toxic people? Well, those same people are one step away from being incredibly positive, affirming, loving and encouraging.\n Principle # 2. To shift from negative emotion to positive one (Which is one inch, one step, one second away\u0026hellip; Remember?) you must decisively turn in the opposite destination.  Most people look at me at this point and say\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Really? Is it that simple?\u0026rdquo; Well, yes!\nGoing back to the example of the car. The \u0026ldquo;car\u0026rdquo; is energy. The \u0026ldquo;car\u0026rdquo; is the same whether you go north or south.\nIf you are going north and you suddenly realize that\u0026rsquo;s not where you want to go (negative energy-negative emotions) don\u0026rsquo;t fight it! Instead, turn around and go south! (positive energy-positive emotions).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the thinking that gets you in trouble, not the emotions. Why do you have to think about it? Hating hurts! So does loving! But the result is different! Determination to finish your educational goals will make you sweat! Determination to commit criminal and destructive acts will make you sweat too! The results are different. People get stuck in the thinking. Why Am I feeling this way? The moment you realize that self-victimization cost you exactly the same price as growth, but the results are different, why do you have to continue thinking and ruminating?\nThree simple steps.\n1. Suspend the thinking and just visualize the destination.\nHate and loving take the same energy. Right? The destination will be different. Why do you need a week to think about it.\nVengeance and forgiveness will suck the same amount of energy out of you. Destination? End result? Total opposites. One leaves you empty, full of toxic, sick, the other is blessed by God, it makes you a better person!\n2. While you suspend the ruminating, the thinking, make a decisive choice!\nChoose the destination you know is the best for you. If you want to talk about loving yourself\u0026hellip; Do it now! Make the most beneficial choice for you.\nThe best way to DEAL with negative energy is not to fight against it but instead, CHOOSE to make positive use of that energy by redirecting it. No one can choose for you. That is your unique privilege. CHOICE is your ultimate right. Blaming, lying, excusing, cheating, justifying, explaining or reacting is just a symptom that shows you are not willing to CHOOSE and assume responsibility for harnessing your RAW ENERGY. It is very sad and even painful, to observe someone experiencing so much negative energy while knowing that the same person is so close to being a magnificent force for good. Some of the bitterest people I have dealt with are those who are just one inch from being the most loving people. Just one inch! One second away. One decisive choice away. The worst marital conflicts that often end up in divorce and wounded children were just one inch away from turning into magnificent marriages! What a waste! Personal choice is the one switch that makes a world of difference.\nThe law of replacement works this way: Your brain will never be inactive. Not for a split second unless you are dead! Your brain will never be on neutral. There will always be something replacing something. Even your \u0026ldquo;dream\u0026rdquo; system is meant to fuel your energy. Did you ever have a bad dream and you were filled with negative energy all day long? Did you experience the same with a happy dream? Have you ever finished a conversation with a negative person that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to resolve a conflict and you end up with negative energy? Have you ever had a dialogue with a positive person that affirms you and you feel totally positive at the end of the conversation? Fuel is anything that enters your brain or emotional system. Fuel will produce energy!\nBut you see, you are always in control of what enters your brain and emotional system. Even when you face a negative person you can choose to fuel your brain with positive thoughts. That is the role of healthy spirituality and a relationship with God. When you walk with God, you are never alone. Angels are around you. The Spirit of God is talking to you! You are receiving a constant flow of positive energy!\nThe moment you see the destination, you must suspend thinking, make a choice to turn around, and immediately start feeding your mind with positive fuel.\nREPLACE hate with love by an act of the will. REPLACE unloving actions with thoughts of affirmation. REPLACE hostility with forgiveness. REPLACE the raw anger and bitterness you experience with thoughts of God and His grace. REPLACE guilt and remorse with grace. REPLACE regret with hope. REPLACE fear with trust. REPLACE frustration with calmness. REPLACE victimization (\u0026ldquo;Poor little me!\u0026rdquo;) with personal responsibility and growth. REPLACE negative feelings by going into nature or going to the gym. Physical exercise works wonders by changing your brain chemistry. REPLACE selfishness with time spent with someone that needs help. REPLACE hostility with meditation and reflection.\nNo matter what\u0026rsquo;s coming your way, you can redirect the power of your life in a positive direction. Remember what you\u0026rsquo;re in favor of, and put your life into it. As long as you keep looking at what you don\u0026rsquo;t want, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you will get! Apply this to marriage, divorce, parenting, work situations, family tensions.\n \u0026ldquo;Our Scriptures tell us that if you see your enemy hungry, go buy that person lunch, or if he\u0026rsquo;s thirsty, get him a drink. Your generosity will surprise him with goodness. Don\u0026rsquo;t let evil get the best of you; get the best of evil by doing good.\u0026rdquo; Romans 12:21 (The Message) In the power of God, you can turn negativity into positive! Give it a try. You will get totally hooked on it. I promise!\n Simple thoughts to replace negativity into positive energy:\n  Pray. Talk to God. Visualize God. Raise the palms of your hands to God and give him the negative stuff. Put your kids on the palm of your hand\u0026hellip; One by one, and watch God\u0026hellip; Watch how he hugs them, talks to them\u0026hellip;\n  Find a coach, a mentor that loves you, and is able to give you feedback\u0026hellip; Ask your spouse to be brutally honest with you. Ask your kids. If you listen and open up, people will tell you what they see\u0026hellip; You will harvest incredible support from people who love you!\n  Read your Bible in a version that speaks your language. You must hear God speaking to you. Read the Psalms. I can not tell you what the Psalms do for me when I face negative force in my life.\n  Choose to focus on the magnificent things happening in your life right now. Stuff you don\u0026rsquo;t think about. Roof over your head. A job. Friends. Marriage is not the answer to loneliness and boredom! A life of purpose and service is. Find your purpose in life. Your purpose will drive you to the most amazing people in the world!\n  Stop trying to be right all the time. Who needs that? Really\u0026hellip; What about just listening and asking questions? It is so boring to be around opinionated, predictable, non creative people\u0026hellip;\n  Stop Worrying # By God\u0026rsquo;s design, we all have a natural reflex. A natural reflex is just what you do when you face any situation. God made us that way! You don\u0026rsquo;t have to teach a child a natural reflex. If a child touches something hot, he will recoil. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave his hand there, but will pull it back. That is a natural reflex! Same when someone hurts you emotionally. Same when you face an unexpected problem. Natural reflexes are not bad. They could actually save your life!\nThen there is a conditioned reflex. This is what you learn in time. It\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;crisis management.\u0026rdquo; You learn how to respond to situations. When you learn to drive, for instance, it is not easy at first. You are conscious of everything you are doing. But after awhile, it gets easier. And before you know it, your driving has become a series of conditioned reflexes. The better you train yourself in the area of conditioned reflexes, the better you will be able to handle the unexpected.\nSo what should you do when you face a personal crisis? Running away won\u0026rsquo;t help! Repressing and denying reality won\u0026rsquo;t help either! Worrying makes it worse.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when you need to resist your natural reflex, and exercise, and develop, the best conditioned reflex for the moment.\nFor example, in times of trouble, some people turn to other people. There is a healthy place for that conditioned reflex. That is certainly better than getting drunk, or doing drugs, or tuning out by pretending that a bad situation does not exist. But, you see, Friend, ultimately, people cannot meet all your needs. No one will be able to do that for you. There comes a time when you need supernatural power to manage a crisis successfully! And by the way, this is a huge issue in long term marriages that end up in divorce. Usually there are mountains of unmet expectations, unresolved conflict, and deep disappointment. No one, should be expected to fulfill all of your needs. It\u0026rsquo;s impossible!\nSo, here is the conditioned reflex that will become the best prescription against worrying, running away, stressing out, going crazy, or avoiding a crisis altogether!\nTurn to God.\nIt is that simple, yet it takes a well disciplined conditioned reflex to do it. In the midst of unmet needs and expectations, turn to God! In the midst of a dark storm, turn to God! When sad, depressed, unable to get hold of yourself, turn to God!\nPhilippians 4:6 tells us:\n\u0026ldquo;Be anxious for NOTHING, but in EVERYTHING by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.\u0026rdquo;\nThe best prescription for worry is prayer, understanding the promises of God, reading the Bible, praising Him, and placing everything in His hands. Let me share with you what I do every morning. I actually raise the palms of my hands to God while I pray. I place each one of my kids on those palms. One by one. I place marriages I am praying for. I place people I have not even met but request prayers for a particular issue. It helps me to visualize, the act of surrendering. That\u0026rsquo;s why I kneel. God is not impressed by that! No one sees me. It is my mental state that matters. It is good for my mind.

It make the Bible even greater! Almost 4.000 years ago, David was describing what we see today! Amazing, the greatness of God, Almighty!\n\u0026ldquo;God, brilliant Lord, yours is a household name. Nursing infants gurgle choruses about you; toddlers shout the songs that drown out enemy talk, and silence atheist babble.\u0026rdquo;\n**\u0026ldquo;I look up at your MACRO-SKIES, dark and enormous,\nyour handmade sky-jewelry, moon and stars mounted in their settings. Then I look at my MICRO-SELF and wonder, Why do you bother with us? Why take a second look our way?\u0026rdquo;**\n\u0026ldquo;Yet we\u0026rsquo;ve so narrowly missed being gods, bright with Eden’s dawn light. You put us in charge of your handcrafted world, repeated to us your Genesis-charge, Made us lords of sheep and cattle, even animals out in the wild, Birds flying and fish swimming, whales singing in the ocean deeps.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;God, brilliant Lord, your name echoes around the world.\u0026rdquo;\n  Do you wonder why Lucifer turned against God? He gave \u0026ldquo;created humans\u0026rdquo; more than what he ever got. I believe Lucifer found out about God\u0026rsquo;s plan to create such an amazing world for these new creatures with the ability to pro-create themselves, enjoy life, pleasure, love, each other, and he went ballistic! Envy ate him alive! It was \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; that antagonized Lucifer against God. Envy. Greed. Pride. His broken religion and idolatry drove him crazy!\n  God\u0026rsquo;s universe is beyond what we understand. So vast. How many planets are inhabited beyond Hubble? How many natural scenes from \u0026ldquo;another world\u0026rdquo; are there to be discovered and explored? Yet, God chose planet earth to be the capital of His universe? He put everything on the line for you and me?\n  And\u0026hellip; God is here with us? With you and me, 24/7?\n  The same power that created 100 billion galaxies, is the same power God has available to love you in our infirmities, in your temptations, at the moments when you fall, when you doubt.\n  He forgives your sins—every one. He heals your diseases—every one. He redeems you from hell—saves your life! He crowns you with love and mercy—a paradise crown. He wraps you in goodness—beauty eternal. He renews your youth—you\u0026rsquo;re always young in his presence. God MAKES EVERYTHING COME OUT RIGHT; HE PUTS VICTIMS BACK ON THEIR FEET. He showed Moses how he went about his work, opened up his plans to all Israel. God is sheer mercy and grace; NOT EASILY ANGERED, he\u0026rsquo;s rich in love. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t endlessly nag and scold, nor hold grudges forever. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t treat us as our sins deserve, nor pay us back in full for our wrongs. As high as heaven is over the earth, so strong is his LOVE to those who fear him. And as far as sunrise is from sunset, he has separated us from our sins. As parents feel for their children, God feels for those who fear him. He knows us inside and out, keeps in mind that we\u0026rsquo;re made of mud. Men and women don\u0026rsquo;t live very long; like wildflowers they spring up and blossom, But a storm snuffs them out just as quickly, leaving nothing to show they were here. God\u0026rsquo;s LOVE, though, is ever and always, eternally present to all who fear him, Making everything right for them and their children God has set his throne in heaven; he rules over us all. He\u0026rsquo;s the King!\n Psalm 103, Message  Would you trust God today? He is watching everything. He knows everything. He won’t drop you.\nKing David composed a song to declare the goodness of God. One of my favorites Psalms.

That\u0026rsquo;s the God that drives me, and moves me to do what I do! He has been good to me beyond my wildest dreams!\n“God is good!” has become my mantra, when people question things, when people write about their most inner secrets. God is always good! I believe that religion misses the goodness of God, in attempting to make sure people get God’s holiness, justice and wrath. God’s holiness is rooted in His love. God’s justice is based on His love. God’s wrath is driven by a love that is beyond our comprehension. We don’t have a mind to understand the holy passion of God for humanity! The cross, the death of Jesus, what he endured only give us glimpses of a LOVE that beyond our rational grasp!\n\u0026ldquo;Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, NOT REALIZING THAT GOD\u0026rsquo;S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?\u0026rdquo; Romans 2:4 (NIV)\nDo you realize, Friend, that God\u0026rsquo;s goodness, grace and compassion is intended to melt your heart? His goodness is intended to make you feel loved, cared for, so in turn you can love others? You are not just one more in the mass of people. You are God\u0026rsquo;s special creation. There is no one else in the world like you! God is watching you day in and day out!\n If you let God love you, you will experience an outpouring of His presence that will drive you to be generous, give, love, care for others, tell them about God\u0026rsquo;s gift of grace\u0026hellip;\n If God\u0026rsquo;s love and goodness doesn\u0026rsquo;t drive to love your spouse, your children, your friends, your co-workers, your employees, your boss, the people of your world, nothing else will! If the goodness and the extravagant love of God doesn\u0026rsquo;t drive to give generously, nothing else will! God is good, Friend!\nI believe God is good and He takes delight in doing good things for people. He does indeed hold our hand in times of trouble and helps us stand against the onslaught of life’s difficulties.\nIn the midst of whatever is going on in your life today, I invite you to pause and reflect on God. King David describes in powerful words, God’s character. We can verily grasp the depth of these words.\nKing David composed a song to declare the goodness of God. One of my favorites Psalms.

REST for those who walk with God. Sunday, was the beginning of a new chapter. The resurrection of Jesus! He did no only rest from the work of SALVATION on behalf of humanity, but He sealed it with a new victory\u0026hellip; ETERNAL LIFE!\nGod is the victor for ever! Satan has been defeated for ever! So, whose side are you on?\n"}).add({id:6,href:"/docs/book/god-is-simple/",title:"God is Simple",description:"Religion teaches you that you have to do a bunch of things to reach perfection in the eyes of God.

If you believe and walk on the state of perfection God has declared for you, you will die forgiven, though imperfect. You are perfect by God\u0026rsquo;s TOTAL, complete forgiveness, though you will always remain imperfect as a human being! The opposite of what I am describing here is PERFECTIONISM. Perfectionism is a constant striving towards being better and better (morality) in order to gain the acceptance of God, and also earn reward or points towards a better looking mansion in heaven! Wow! Everything in our culture strive to teach you that you earn status by adopting rules and standards. Consequences is what corrects behavior, mostly. God, instead, begins with love, forgiveness and freedom!\nHere is the reality, friend, unless you read the simple story of God from the Bible, unless you let God love you FIRST, and believe every single hour and day that you ARE perfect in the eyes of God, you will be confused by what religion will tell you! Religion will tell you that you are PERFECT if\u0026hellip; if\u0026hellip; if\u0026hellip; God says, \u0026ldquo;YOU ARE! GO INTO THE WORLD AND LIVE IT OUT!\u0026rdquo;\nIf you choose to walk on the perfection God gave you, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to try to be better, you simply need to surrender to the power of the God who is with you all the time (The Holy Spirit). The improvements and changes of your life you get by effort and sacrifice DO NOT IMPRESS GOD at all! They don\u0026rsquo;t matter. What matters is your humble surrender to the transforming power of God. And that is the fundamental difference between RELIGION and a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.\nGRACE: Nothing is more explosive in the Bible than the concept grace. This is the bottom line that separates all RELIGIONS (Including the Christian religion) from those WHO have a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. RELIGION is the attempt to help God, to reach out to HIM. A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD starts with God, it follows that you surrender to His love, and God finishes the world of perfecting you. In GRACE, who believe in a 100%, undiluted, raw GRACE rooted RELATIONSHIP with God.\n\u0026ldquo;What actually took place is this: I TRIED keeping rules and working my head off to please God, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. So I quit being a \u0026ldquo;law man\u0026rdquo; so that I could be God\u0026rsquo;s man. Christ\u0026rsquo;s life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I appear righteous before you or have your good opinion, and I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me. The life you see me living is not \u0026ldquo;mine,\u0026rdquo; but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I am not going to go back on that.\u0026rdquo; Galatians 2:20-21 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;Is it not clear to you that to go back to that old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion would be an abandonment of everything personal and free in my relationship with God? I refuse to do that, to repudiate God\u0026rsquo;s grace. If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily.\u0026rdquo; Powerful words of Jesus!\nOne of the marks of a follower of God is simplicity. Simplicity in our culture tends to have negative connotations. When we speak of someone who is \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; we don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean it as a virtue. But in the Bible simplicity is the basic quality of those who will live with God throughout eternity. Did you know that? Here are the words of Jesus\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;For an answer Jesus called over a child, whom he stood in the middle of the room, and said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m telling you, once and for all, that unless you return to square one and start over like children, you\u0026rsquo;re not even going to get a look at the kingdom, let alone get in. Whoever becomes SIMPLE and ELEMENTAL again, like this child, will rank high in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. What\u0026rsquo;s more, when you receive the childlike on my account, it\u0026rsquo;s the same as receiving me.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 18:2-5 - The Message\n\u0026ldquo;God is simple\u0026hellip; stop complicating your life with religion and personal anxiety\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nIn Matthew 6 you will catch a glimpse of God\u0026rsquo;s view that states that the \u0026ldquo;flow,\u0026rdquo; enjoying the now, being free from worry and anxiety is the way to experience God\u0026rsquo;s best for you. On the other side \u0026ldquo;religion, and trying to be and do\u0026rdquo; is the best way to lose sight of God\u0026rsquo;s presence.\nMatthew 6 introduces you into God\u0026rsquo;s wholeness, God\u0026rsquo;s simplicity and begs you to walk into it and let yourself be. Read it slowly and you will get the idea Jesus is trying to convey.\n“Be especially careful when you are trying to be good so that you don’t make a performance out of it. It might be good theater, but the God who made you won’t be applauding.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 6 (The Message)\n“When you do something for someone else, don’t call attention to yourself. You’ve seen them in action, I’m sure—‘playactors’ I call them—treating prayer meeting and street corner alike as a stage, acting compassionate as long as someone is watching, playing to the crowds. They get applause, true, but that’s all they get. When you help someone out, don’t think about how it looks. Just do it—quietly and unobtrusively. THAT IS THE WAY YOUR GOD, WHO CONCEIVED YOU IN LOVE, WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES, HELPS YOU OUT.\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Summing it all up, I\u0026rsquo;d say you\u0026rsquo;ll do best by filling your minds and meditating on things true, noble, reputable, authentic, compelling, GRACIOUS—the BEST, not the worst; the BEAUTIFUL, not the ugly; things to PRAISE, not things to curse. Put into practice what you learned from me, what you heard and saw and realized. Do that, and God, who makes everything work together, will work you into his most excellent harmonies.\u0026rdquo; What you just read is in the Bible. God is into the beauty of simplicity. Philippians 4:8 (The Message)\nSimplicity in its true meaning, and out of the frame of the four misconceptions I listed above, can be a powerful voice for God. Children are simple. The most passionate love is simple. Authentic emotions are simple, as opposed to neurotic and twisted manifestations of denial.\nHow to Be Happy # Psalm 119:1-8 (The Message) contains THE SECRET TO BE BLESSED BY GOD.\n You\u0026rsquo;re blessed when you stay on course, walking steadily on the road revealed by God. You\u0026rsquo;re blessed when you follow his directions, doing your best to find him. That\u0026rsquo;s right—you don\u0026rsquo;t go off on your own; you walk straight along the road he set. You, God, PRESCRIBED THE RIGHT WAY TO LIVE; now you expect us to live it. Oh, that my steps might be steady, keeping to the course you set; Then I\u0026rsquo;d never have any regrets in comparing my life with your counsel. I thank you for speaking straight from your heart; I learn the pattern of your righteous ways. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do what you tell me to do; don\u0026rsquo;t ever walk off and leave me.\n These verses describe exactly the opposite of what religion is all about. If you read the words of King David carefully, you will find out the he is talking about obedience here. But his description of obedience is RELATIONAL. Obedience is the result of a relationship with God, that is so precious to you, that you long to walk with Him, you long to learn His way!\nGod prescribes the right way to live. That is the fundamental truth of the Bible. If you want to obtain the best of life, learn God\u0026rsquo;s way and respond to His invitation. Don\u0026rsquo;t seek to fulfill your life with anything else but the will and the presence of God!\nGod will not only share with you the best life to live ever on this earth, but will also enable you, with transforming power, to become what He has set you to be in fulfilling your purpose.\nHow to Live Your Best Life # We are born to dream. We are born to fly high with ideas. We are born to be creative. I love watching kids play. We are made by God to dream big dreams, and think of the best life has to offer. The human imagination has no limit. God is not against you LIVING YOUR BEST LIFE EVER. All to the contrary, He wants to do the opposite of what the world does\u0026hellip; The world and the culture bring you down, help you to get stuck in a rut, makes you materialistic and dependent on \u0026ldquo;things.\u0026rdquo; We, human, tend to decide what is best for us, we obsess over those things, we abhor what we label as unpleasant, and then miss the magnificent opportunities God has for us!\nRomans 12:1-2-The Message [My comments]\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s what I want you to do, God helping you:\n1) TAKE YOUR EVERYDAY, ORDINARY LIFE—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—\n[Think of all the basics of your life\u0026hellip; a roof over your head\u0026hellip; a job\u0026hellip; family\u0026hellip; friends\u0026hellip; opportunities\u0026hellip; school\u0026hellip; career\u0026hellip;]\n2) and place it before God as an offering.\n[Bring everything to God as an offering\u0026hellip; the ability to sleep, walk, work, going to the gym, exercising, eating, going to see a doctor\u0026hellip; money to pay bills\u0026hellip;.

One sign of God\u0026rsquo;s absence in your life is a boring routine with nothing to be grateful and joyful about\u0026hellip;Life is like a treadmill\u0026hellip; ]\nInstead, fix your attention on God. You\u0026rsquo;ll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it.

Love is the most powerful driving force in the universe!\nDo you know God’s love has a purpose?\n“Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that GOD’S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?\u0026quot; Romans 2:4 (NIV)\nThe word “repentance” in the English language does not reflect the true meaning of the word in the original Greek. “Repentance” has its root it the Old Latin which translated the Greek (\u0026ldquo;metanoia\u0026rdquo;) as “paenitentia” which came to mean penance or acts of penance that had to be done if one hoped to obtain grace. By extension it became sorrow, contrition, a penitent attitude.\nThe original word in the Greek “metanoia” is a word loaded with dynamic action. It simply means to “change one’s mind and perception of whatever preceded the act of “metanoia” or ‘repentance” It means you were going in one direction and the sparkle of God’s Spirit enlightened you, and you suddenly saw you are wrong, and changed! You see how offensive your action, disposition and behavior is to God!\nGod’s kindness is intended to lead you to want to CHANGE!\nEverything God does for you has that purpose! To lead you to that moment, or moments of “metanoia.” (Repentance) To lead you into a state of mind and heart that says, “Wow, how could I not change for such a LOVER!” Doesn’t that ring to you like the best motivation for change ever?\nHis love, His kindness, His compassion, His goodness is meant to create in you the desire to change into His likeness! His goodness is to make us generous and compassionate toward others the way He is towards you!\nIf the goodness of God does not melt your heart, and you choose not to change out of pride and selfishness, NOTHING else will do it. If love does not melt your heart, punishment will not do it either! It will make you bitter. If goodness and love do not drive you to love others, a hard life won’t do it either! I have watched people going down into the darkness of their own selfishness, drowning in toxicity, with negative feelings and emotions, demon possessed, bitter against the world… and I have always thought the same… “Wow… They chose not to give in to the goodness of God! They chose to reject love!” That’s why I understand the concept of hell a little bit! There is no hope for someone who rejects love! Only a miserable life! There will be no room in heaven for people who have rejected love. It would be the most miserable existence ever! “Hell” is God’s last resort of grace, for people who reject love. Did you know that?\nGod’s goodness at all levels, and in all its manifestations has ONE SINGLE PURPOSE, Friend…\nTO LEAD YOU TO CHANGE, AND BECOME THE LOVER GOD CREATED YOU TO BE, BEFORE SIN GOT HOLD OF YOU! To take you back to His original purpose… Love will always be the law of His universe!\nDo you feel unworthy?\nDo you feel that no matter how much people tell you, \u0026ldquo;you are good,\u0026rdquo; you still feel like you are not?\nDo you struggle with being human? Has someone planted in your head the idea that the \u0026ldquo;people of God\u0026rdquo; don\u0026rsquo;t commit more sin?\nThere are two reasons why people feel unworthy of God\u0026rsquo;s love and His presence.\n  Living a sinful life, apart from God, by choice. God is being rejected every day, every hour by choice!\n  Confusion about God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness and how He declares you perfect! Religion has made a mess of this! There are many views and doubts regarding this subject. The Bible taken in all its entirety makes it clear. Bible verses, picked to serve one view or other, create the mess religion feeds on!\n  \u0026ldquo;Perfectionism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;reward for goodness\u0026rdquo; are two strong strategies the devil uses to confuse followers of God! All the temptations and strategies the devil uses against people come under two categories, \u0026ldquo;SEDUCTION\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;SUFFERING.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Perfectionism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;reward for goodness\u0026rdquo; fall under seduction. Those two concepts are a delusion that causes enormous confusion when dealing with reality.\nGod promotes \u0026ldquo;wholeness.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Wholeness\u0026rdquo; is the opposite of \u0026ldquo;slices\u0026rdquo; like in a pie. Religion teaches \u0026ldquo;pie Christianity.\u0026rdquo; In other words, God is a slice of your entire life. The best quote born in the soil of such mindset is \u0026ldquo;God helps those who help themselves.\u0026rdquo; Many people believe this is a Bible verse! :-) Followers of God believe and promote \u0026ldquo;wholeness.\u0026rdquo; It means, God pronounces His followers perfect, good, holy, 100% acceptable to be citizens of the Kingdom of God! Under God\u0026rsquo;s eyes, you are 100% when you accept Him in your life. There is no \u0026ldquo;but\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; kind of presupposition! God\u0026rsquo;s declaration of perfection is absolute, complete and permanent. Are you with me, Friend?\n  Followers of God believe that God helps those who can not help themselves. The best candidates for the kingdom of God are people who are broken, hurting, dissatisfied, up against the wall, disillusioned, frustrated\u0026hellip; people who have failed!\n  Once you accept your complete inability to please God with your \u0026ldquo;human goodness\u0026rdquo; or make Him hate you with you \u0026ldquo;sinfulness,\u0026rdquo; you surrender to God and He accepts you \u0026ldquo;wholly\u0026rdquo;. He declares you perfect! Your act of surrendering, though, is the beginning of perfection at your level of consciousness! You are aware of it now! God is not at a desk, checking a list while you wait in line to be forgiven! :-)\n  Your new awareness of God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness is not an act God performs when you surrender to Him. That\u0026rsquo;s where religion confuses people with \u0026ldquo;before\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;after.\u0026rdquo; Pray the \u0026ldquo;sinners\u0026rsquo; prayer\u0026rdquo; otherwise you are going to hell, say some Christians! Once you surrender to God, God says, to you\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Did you know that during all those years of rejection, you were already forgiven?\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s what is so overwhelming about God\u0026rsquo;s grace! All your sins from the past were forgiven 2.000 years ago on the cross of Calvary! And even 6.000 years ago before planet earth got into this horrible mess called SIN! God was not caught by surprise! God was not caught unprepared for the devil\u0026rsquo;s presence! He knew and made provision.\n  Not only that, all of your future sins have already been forgiven to the day you die. Tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s sins? Forgiven! Next week\u0026rsquo;s sins? Forgiven! Next year\u0026rsquo;s sins? Forgiven! Everything is forgiven! Religious people get very uptight with my statement! But you see, Friend, lovers don\u0026rsquo;t play games! If a follower of God sins intentionally against God\u0026rsquo;s will, because he has been declared \u0026ldquo;saved,\u0026rdquo; he/she does not really understand the love of God! Authentic lovers don\u0026rsquo;t play games with lovers! If a wife says to her husband, \u0026ldquo;I will never leave you, divorce you, even if you do the worst thing you could ever imagine doing to me! Even if you betray me, get totally irritating, boring, unloving\u0026hellip; I will not leave you! The only way you can get rid of me, is by leaving me, and going to a place where I can never find you.\u0026rdquo; That love, that devotion, that loyalty is not be played with lightly! God is like that, Friend! God does not lose by giving you total assurance of forgiveness and perfection. You do, if you play games with God! The same in any human transaction. The giver never loses! Simply gets better!\n  If you are perplexed in your spiritual walk, I want to share with you a magnificent message today. It comes from Romans 3:21-31 (The Message). Read it, think about and ask God to engrave these words in the depths of your brain! Repeat it\u0026hellip; Make it yours, until it finally becomes a part of you! [My comments]\n\u0026ldquo;The God-setting-things-right that we read about has become Jesus-setting-things-right for us. And not only for us, but for everyone who believes in him. For there is no difference between us and them in this. Since we\u0026rsquo;ve compiled this long and sorry record as sinners (both us and them) and PROVED THAT WE ARE UTTERLY INCAPABLE [Please notice the language, \u0026ldquo;utterly incapable.\u0026rdquo; It means that will power, habits, strategies, predisposition, good DNA, background, motivational strategies taught by gurus, religion\u0026hellip; NOTHING! We are \u0026ldquo;utterly incapable\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;] OF LIVING THE GLORIOUS LIVES GOD WILLS FOR US, GOD DID IT FOR US! Out of sheer generosity he put us in RIGHT STANDING with himself. A pure gift. He got us out of the mess we\u0026rsquo;re in and restored us to where he always wanted us to be. And he did it by means of Jesus Christ.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;God sacrificed Jesus on the altar of the world to clear that world of sin. Having faith in him sets us in the clear. God decided on this course of action in full view of the public—to set the world in the clear with himself through the sacrifice of Jesus, finally taking care of the sins he had so patiently endured. This is not only clear, but it\u0026rsquo;s now—this is current history! God sets things right. HE ALSO MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO LIVE IN HIS RIGHTNESS.\u0026rdquo; [The same power that set us right, is also transforming us every day into His likeness!]\n\u0026ldquo;So where does that leave our proud Jewish insider claims and counter-claims? Canceled? Yes, canceled. What we\u0026rsquo;ve learned is this: GOD DOES NOT RESPOND TO WHAT WE DO; WE RESPOND TO WHAT GOD DOES! [Simply amazing!] We\u0026rsquo;ve finally figured it out. Our lives get in step with GOD and ALL OTHERS BY LETTING HIM SET THE PACE, not by proudly or anxiously trying to run the parade.\u0026rdquo; [Did you noticed? The presence of God in your life does not only set you right with Him, but with others also. Lying, falsehood, cheating, hypocrisy, using people for your own purposes\u0026hellip; these are all manifestations that God is not running the show!]\n\u0026ldquo;BUT BY SHIFTING OUR FOCUS FROM WHAT WE DO TO WHAT GOD DOES, don\u0026rsquo;t we cancel out all our careful keeping of the rules and ways God commanded? Not at all. What happens, in fact, is that by putting that entire way of life in its proper place, we confirm it.\u0026rdquo;\nHere is the one strategy that can totally revolutionize your spiritual life, today, Friend! I promise you\u0026hellip; It will eliminate your perplexities, doubts about how good you are, if you are performing according to God\u0026rsquo;s standards. SHIFT YOUR FOCUS FROM WHAT YOU DO, FROM WHAT PEOPLE DO, TO WHAT GOD HAS DONE, IS DOING, AND WILL DO ALL THE WAY TO THE END! God is the God of all people, all around the world!\nGod\u0026rsquo;s Heart for the World # Unbelief, rejection, lack of spiritual passion for a relationship with God, blindness for the needs of people, break God’s heart, because He knows the consequences. But when the door of the human heart is shut, He refuses to enter forcibly. He will only knock, wanting to gain admittance. He has given us the ability to choose. But when we choose the wrong thing, He knows the repercussions that will follow—in this life and the one to come. And His heart is broken.\nWould you recognize God if He would be in your midst? Would you welcome God’s personal visit to you? What if God would visit you in the person of a homeless person? Would you see Him? What if God would come to your church? Would He be allowed to preach? What if God would invite you to make a commitment to Him beyond anything you have ever done? What if God would invite you to have a daily time of devotion with Him? Reading the Bible, praying? Would you have the time for God?\nWhat breaks the heart of God is REJECTION in all its manifestations. Lack of passion for lost people breaks the heart of God. It means you don’t understand how much He loves! Lack of passion for the hungry, the poor, the sick breaks the heart of God! You are His hands and feet on earth!\nWill you accept God in your life today? Will you follow Him? Will you invite someone to join the family of God? Will you pray for lost people? Do you care? It’s all part of God’s invitation to LOVE RECKLESSLY.\nMy Lonely Journey with God # I am a seeker. I am committed to let God love me every day and seek God’s will in the reading of the Bible and the direction of the Holy Spirit.\n \u0026ldquo;Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.\u0026rdquo; (Proverbs 4:27, KJV)\n  \u0026ldquo;Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’\u0026rdquo; (John 14:6)\n  \u0026ldquo;Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matthew 7:13-14)\n THE LONELINESS OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD IS A NARROW ROAD\nSo, I am not politicaly conservative. I don’t believe rules and fear make people authentically loving and compassionate. Conservatism preserves order, civility and protects people from anarchy, but in the end we must hear the voice from and shift from self-centered living to God/Christ/Cross/Gospel centered life.\nI am not a religious person. I don’t believe in religion. I consider religion a human attempt to catch the reality of God from our side of the universe. The word “religion” (Latin: “religare” which means “bond” or “re-unite”) is a good word, but unfortunately it has become a symbol of the human attempt to seek, reject, or make sense of God.\nReligion is in its very essence anthropomorphism (Transfer human views and perceptions on to God).\nReligion is the desperate attempt to make sense of God from a human perspective. I don’t believe you can “theologize” God unless you experienced God in your consciousness. You can talk “about” God, your can practice religion like an addict, you can talk about God like you talk about the weather, or biology, or computer science.\nI am not politicaly liberal. I don’t believe everything goes. I don’t believe the answers to the complex fabric of the human existence are liberal views. Liberalism is as extreme and unrealistic as conservatism is. One is obsessed with “preserving,” the other with “bringing walls down.”\nI BELIEVE IN LETTING GOD LOVE ME, BECAUSE I BELIEVE LOVE IS A POWER THAT CAN TRANSFORM MY LIFE FROM THE INSIDE OUT. Love defines the existential reality and unlimited power of God. I BELIEVE THAT A “RELATIONSHIP” WITH GOD IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE, BUT VITAL TO A LIFE THAT NATURALLY MANIFESTS LOVE AND COMPASSION.\nWhen you believe, repent and receive the Holy Spirt, you must let God LOVE you, God will not make you a Christian, God makes you born again for a heavenly country. God will turn you into a loving, growing mature son/daughter of Heaven.\nWhen you let God LOVE you, you won’t need to try to be a good person. That’s not your job. You will spend time with God, and let God transform you naturally.\nI have found out that a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD when I let God love me, is not about trying to overcome particular sinful behaviors, but a correction of what I believe God is like. This is a radical differentiation with the general spirit of religion.\nThe real PURPOSE behind letting God LOVE you, is to establish a RELATIONSHIP with God, that will grow your consciousness of God’s 24/7 presence in your life and TRANSFORM YOU! When you finally understand that God loves you matter what… When it dawns on you that God is with you no matter what… you will begin to wake up to the reality of a God no religion can teach you about!\n“So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: TAKE YOUR EVERYDAY, ORDINARY LIFE—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—(Yes, your exhausted self, your defeated feelings, your sense of despair, your multiple challenges, all of it) AND PLACE IT BEFORE GOD AS AN OFFERING.\u0026rdquo;\nA love relationship with God will heal you by changing your beliefs about God and transforming you into who you are meant to be. Meaning and purpose are embedded in this concept of becoming.\nWhen you let God love you first, you suddenly realize you are part of a history that spans all through human history.\nYou become part of the body of God eternally connected with a huge, worldwide, global, historical, and timeless crowd of believers.\nYou begin to read the stories of the Biblical narratives and you suddenly identify with King David who lived and wrote many of the Psalms almost 3.000 years ago. You identify with Abraham who lied twice letting other men take his gorgeous wife to protect himself from being killed. Yet God chose him for a special mission.\nYou read in the Gospels about rough fishermen who became followers of God as Jesus. You read about a religion that hated his guts, while humble, broken people came to him to be healed and be comforted by him.\nYou were there 2.000 years ago. Those human beings were not much different than you and I. The words of Jesus begin to speak to you.\nAs your relationship with God matures, God stirs your heart for other people. As you connect with God, you find your heart going out like never before to people around in your sphere of action. Your relationship with God fuels and creates a longing for a relationship with your spouse, your neighbors, your kids.\nYour relationship with God ignites in you a desire to connect and relate to others. The mark of God in your life becomes love, compassion, grace towards people who suffer and are needy.\nYet as you go deeper in your personal relationship with God you begin to find another reality Pastors, megachurches, religion and Christian friends don’t tell you about because they have seldom experienced it.\nSuddenly God becomes the center of attention in your life. Your consciousness of God grows, deepens, and expands.\nYou realize God is with you all the time whether you are aware of it or not. You also realize God loves you no matter what you do. This shocks most people because they have been told by religion that God only likes “nice” people, and those who only do what God wants them to do.\nYour consciousness of God’s love drives you to begin to practice a lifestyle of reckless and radical abandonment, by making God your sole desire and highest delight in life.\nYou find yourself conversing with God before going to sleep, or when you wake up in the morning. Or you decide to turn your radio off when you drive to chat with God.\nYou find yourself longing for intimacy with God.\nThis is what I have chosen to call in my own experience the “costly” side of my relationship with God. That’s when you begin to experience the attacks of demonic forces. You also experience antagonism from religious people.\nThis side of the relationship with God is costly because the crowd is not with you. Perhaps you know one or two people who share the same passion with you.\nYou find yourself struggling with the superficiality of religion in sermon, articles, books and social media.\nIntimacy with God is costly. Here is the beauty of it.\nThe more you let God love you, the more you will experience love, and the more reckless and radical you will become in your response to people who feel antagonistic against you.\nThe more you let God love you the more naturally changes will happen in your life. Why? Because a walk with God is not about “trying” to be good and change, but letting God change you.\nThe more you catch a glimpse of the love of God, the more you will be attracted to broken people. The less you will be affected adversely by people who find you weird, too passionate about God, and compassionate about the needy.\nI get a glimpse now of the spiritual loneliness and frustration Job experienced away from the church gathering, and the popularity of religious power. Wow… For all practical purposes he was perceived as a religious fiasco, a loser, a lost man.\nJob was harassed by the leadership of God’s true church at the time. Job struggled, agonized, and did not surrendered to orthodox, conservative theology. He stood rooted in a personal knowledge of God.\nWhen Job’s religious, conservative wife saw her husband suffering she said, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? (Your belief in your kind of God) Curse “God” and die!\u0026quot; (Job 2:9 - NIV)\nThe real dark loneliness of Job’s journey was caused by a clash between the lies of conservative religion about God, and his own experiential knowledge of God.\nIn response to Pastors who attempted to dissuade him with conservative theology, his own personal, emotional, mental, and physical agony, the loneliness he must have experienced, Job stood up and said,\n“So hold your tongue while I have my say, then I’ll take whatever I have coming to me. Why do I go out on a limb like this and take my life in my hands? (Why do I risk my own existence? Why do I put my own life on the line by standing against your conservative theology AND YOUR LIES ABOUT GOD?)\u0026quot;\nAnd here comes Job’s stunning answer…\n“BECAUSE (I know God so well) that EVEN IF HE KILLED ME, I’D KEEP ON HOPING. I’d defend my innocence (against your accusations based on lies about the character of God) to the very end. Just wait, this is going to work out for the best—my salvation!\u0026quot;(Job 13:15 - The Message)\nJob’s experience gets to the core of what I am describing as spiritual loneliness in a journey with God while surrounded by people who don’t comprehend your path, unless they are or have been there.\nWhat Job did not know, because he was not privy to the information we can read in the book today, is that the conservative theologians who confronted Job day and day out, were part of a demonic strategy to destroy Job. Job was a test case for the whole universe to see. God knew about it. God allowed the test case to take place to prove that love wins over pain, suffering and fear. Of course, Job and the conservative religious Pastors did not know what was behind.\nIt’s simply a fascinating story when put in the context of today’s contemporary religious landscape.\nI understand Abraham’s broken human nature, manipulative behavior, allowing men to take his gorgeous wife twice to protect his own life. He became very wealthy because he lied, and the King bestowed fortune on him, driven by fear of punishment by the “gods.” What would you say of that kind of wealth created by someone today?\nin spite of it, God saw in Abraham a struggling sinner with a mission, a purpose. Abraham’s lack of faith in God’s promise, like many of us, drove him to “help” God, which created a mess we are still dealing with as a global community, 4.000 years later. It just blows your mind!\nI thank God every day for the Biblical narratives that shed light on the human fabric, how broken it is, how fragile, how twisted, and then on the other side of the spectrum glimpses of the character of God.\nI understand the loneliness of King David, as a fallen sinner in the presence of God. Persecuted day and day out by his enemies, and his own family. Suffering the consequences of his own fall, David surrendered in the presence of God and saw the face of God’s grace, mercy and redemptive power.\nDavid did not find affirmation in the Jewish religion of the time, but in a personal relationship with God. Yes, God used a prophet to get his attention, but the spiritual journey was David’s and David’s alone.\nI read the Psalms and I find in them a guy who was intimately connected to God. A struggling sinner hanging on to God. His hymns, poems, and utterances about God were born in a deep empirical consciousness of God’s presence you don’t learn by reasoning, or simply theologizing God. It’s knowledge rooted in a relationship.\nYOU WILL FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXISTENTIAL LONELINESS IN THEIR JOURNEY WITH GOD\nThere is a depth of fellowship only available between like-minded (or rather: like-spirited) souls that share the same depth in their relationship with God. They have experience the same intensity and passion for God. They have “seen” with the eyes of faith the same treasures, and “tasted” the same pleasures of heaven.\nThese are people who may looked ruined socially, economically, but they are rich spiritually. Their hearts are fixed on the same thing and they share the same commitments.\nBelieve it or not, many of these people are homeless, some of them are struggling with mental disturbances, they are suffering, they carry the scars of painful memories of the past, abandonment, and abuse. They know a God I know, and we can talk about the same God!\nAnd let me add that the people I meet and connect because we know the same God, are not religious conservatives. They are not denominational loyalists. They don’t push organized religion as the “way” into the Kingdom of God. They are not social liberals. They are not obsessed with social justice, for the sake of activism, THOUGHT they stand for love and compassion (as God does, above legalism, right and wrong) as the core of God’s call in their lives… They are the modern “JOBs” experiencing a personal relationship with God which I call mystical, real, profoundly satisfying, and manifested in a life of humble service and compassion for others.\nThey may be suffering, they may not be successful in the eyes of the culture but we know the same God.\nThis is the narrow road. This is a lonely journey!\nVery often in this kind of walk with God you truly feel like a peg in a square hole. A misfit. You get fingers pointing at you from all directions.\n “You, GOD, are MY GOD, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.\u0026quot; (Psalm 63:1 - NIV)\n GOD’S PEOPLE ARE NOT GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD. OFTEN IN THE MIDST OF A LONELY JOURNEY LIKE YOU\nI have to think of all these believers in the spiritual outbacks of this world. Those who cultivate lovesick hearts and an ever growing hunger for the presence and the knowledge of God where no one else does.\nPeople in nations or regions that die from spiritual hunger without realizing, people who belong to the few who cultivate the secret place of intimacy and wholeheartedness before God without having any support from the people around them or any people around them who inspire them to give even more and go even deeper.\nI have to think of the people who, after having been touched by God in a mighty way, return to their traditional, conservative, lukewarm churches where no one has a paradigm for what they have experienced.\nI have to think of the missionary couple who moved to a spiritually desolate region, completely stripped of any spiritual fellowship apart from each other to serve the needy.\nI have to think of the young man who encountered God in the most weird kind of experience (he told me he felt weird) and due to a lack of other Christians in his area started reading Matthew 5, 6, the words of Jesus on his own while his atheist parents scolded him for his insanity and religious fanaticism. He ended up joining a Buddhist community and his spiritual experience and connection with God put me to shame.\nI have to think of the group of people who consistently come together and experienced the most intense prayer meetings, with crying and sobbing in, and because of the measure of the presence of God in their prayer meetings, they ventured to help people no one in the entire city understood, but they were compelled to do it by the love of God.\nThese are the modern day hermits.\nPeople who - while living in cities, surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people, even while being part of communities of believers or secular people - find themselves in a spiritual desert of loneliness.\nThese are the spiritual hermits who understand the words of David and cry with the same longing and commitment:\nSOON OR LATER YOU AND I WILL BE FACED WITH GOD’S CALL TO LEAVE EVERYTHING BEHIND, LET GOD LOVE US, AND FOLLOW GOD IN THE WORLD. IT’S ALL ABOUT LOVE!\nLove calls you and me to press on, to go deeper in in our relationship with God, to get to know God more as we journey together.\nOnce you have experienced the love of God, you will be emboldened like Job was.\nYou can’t go back, you can’t just stay where you are. You burned the theological bridges and the lies who kept you imprisoned in fear and legalism.\nTo the one who has tasted of God’s liberating grace backing down is an act of highest stupidity anyone is capable of. You are ruined for ever if you choose to reject such love. God does not stop loving you. You become miserable running away from God!\nLove’s longing is to give everything, surrender all, leave everything behind to cling to God, just as a lover embraces a lover in real life. “Counting the cost” (Luke 14:27-28 - NIV) makes sense in a capitalistic culture, but really… that religious approach to a relationship with God was “yesterday,” when you did not know better. “Calculating the cost” of a relationship with God is an absolutely absurd idea to the one consumed with yearning for the God who loves you beyond your wildest imagination!\n"}).add({id:8,href:"/docs/book/gospel-good-news/",title:"The Gospel is Good News",description:"Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

Good and bad people alike! Our nature is fragmented, stubborn, selfish, self-centered. Our condition, just by breathing on this planet and having our parents genes, is SINFUL. Good people need God to be really good, as much as bad people do! And if we don\u0026rsquo;t surrender to God, we will find ourselves, the good and the bad in us, fighting against God! (Romans 7-8; Galatians 5)\nPeople are not going to fully appreciate the good news until they experience freedom, inner healing, and the ability to share joy and wholeness with others. That was the problem with the Pharisees in the time of Jesus. They did not intentionally made difficult for people to walk with God! It started as a \u0026ldquo;LET\u0026rsquo;S HELP YOU FIND THE STEPS TO WALK WITH GOD!\u0026rdquo; And by the time they were done they had created an impossible system to follow! That\u0026rsquo;s the trap, the BIG TEN of the law of God, broken down in \u0026ldquo;HOW TOs\u0026rdquo; became burdensome, and the good news were no longer good! Jesus came to show us the way. God\u0026rsquo;s way makes you free, indeed!\nIf we will be faithful to the spirit of the gospel, we should always allow the Spirit of God TO BUILD A BRIDGE, BETWEEN THE HERE AND NOW, AND THE LOVE OF GOD THAT DOESN’T\u0026rsquo; WANT ANYONE TO PERISH! (2 Peter 3:9). The pulsating core of the Good News is that God reaches out to us, FIRST, (1 John 4:9) and then He finishes the work of perfection in our lives! (Philippians 1: 6). Your only role in this whole process is to make a choice: “Yes” or “No.\u0026quot;\n“Then you will know the TRUTH and the TRUTH will set you free!” And the truth is not a dogma, it’s not a theological statement, it is not a set of beliefs! The question is not WHAT but WHO is the truth. In the Bible TRUTH is always relational and the end result is always freedom!; not religious and legalistic slavery and fear! Jesus said, “I am the TRUTH” (John 14:6) God is the TRUTH. The only way to know the truth is by RELATING to Him.\n The true Gospel of God, will always be GOOD NEWS. And the GOOD NEWS will always be about freedom!\n Do not accept any other Gospel! Be suspicious of a Gospel which feels like a heavy brick on your shoulders. Take a second look at a Gospel that drives you by fear! If the TRUTH does not free you, it is not the truth of God! Notice, I never said, there would be no difficulties in accepting the Gospel of God\u0026rsquo;s freedom. We are conditioned by culture and religion to no believe it, or experience it!\nWalking in the world, believing the true gospel of God\u0026hellip;Believing that God has freed you from sin forever, is the toughest challenge ever!\n"}).add({id:9,href:"/docs/book/who-is-jesus-christ/",title:"Who is Jesus Christ?",description:"The Uniqueness of Christ Your browser does not support the audio element.

Jesus could have had Niagara Falls appear before Him if He so desired. But instead He said, “I thirst.”\nThis reminds us that although Jesus Christ was fully God, He also was fully man. Never for a moment did He give up His Divinity, though He did not displayed it in His miraculous events at will. He shrouded His glory. He was still always God. But the miracles He performed He promised you and I could perform also. He showed us the way. He led the way for you and me. (John 14:12) That is why His death, His voluntary death, and His death alone, was sufficient to meet the righteous demands of the Father. Amazing!\nTake a moment today to thank God for becoming “Emmanuel,” God with us. He came to us, that we may know His supreme love. That we may follow Him, like He followed His Heavenly Father, even though, He was God! That His love may compels us to obey God, as Jesus obeyed God, even though He was still God!\nIf you want to start a relationship with Jesus Christ, or have fallen away and want to rededicate your life to Christ. Simply come to Him humbly by faith, confessing your sin and need of a Savior. Each person must sort out what to say to Jesus for himself, but one might try praying something like this:\n\u0026ldquo;Jesus, I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry that I have been going my own way and not Your way. But I thank You so much for loving me enough to come and die for my sins. And now I\u0026rsquo;m so happy that in resurrecting you are alive and well, and I want to know You. Please come into my life, change my heart and mind, and let me know you deeply. I recognize You as King, please teach me how to obey and love You.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And being found in appearance as a man, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.\u0026rdquo;--Philippians 2:8\nMore and more I wonder how would Jesus look and behave in our contemporary culture. You know why I wonder? Because the people of His time went crazy with His humble demeanor. Read the Gospels. They thought He was a fraud! He did not match the hero they had come to expect of their prophesied and idolized image of the Messiah! They liked His power manifested in miracles and healing, but they did not know what to do with his humbleness. Judah would have loved to see Jesus manifesting His power. He would have been Jesus\u0026rsquo; campaign manager! Peter would have loved nothing less. The entire nation of Israel would have felt that their destiny had finally been fulfilled! Imagine!\nIf you were Jesus (God), would you ever be tempted to do a miracle for yourself? I probably would. If I had been Jesus, instead of walking long distances, I would have just said, \u0026ldquo;I am now going to be there,\u0026rdquo; and there I would be.\nA peek into an experience Jesus had tells a lot about His humble and obedient disposition.

Would he feel comfortable in our mega-churches? Would He feel comfortable with religion? Would He attend our large institutional churches? Where would you find Him? Would He be allowed to preach from the pulpits that proclaim to be the authentic church of God on earth? Where would you find Jesus? With what kind of people would He chose to spend time with? Would you consider Him a lesser Jesus because He would offer to sleep in your couch at your apartment? Would you expect Him to own His own airplane, stay in resorts, expensive hotels? Think about humble Jesus for a minute!\n Take a moment today to thank God for becoming \u0026ldquo;Emmanuel,\u0026rdquo; God with us. He came to us, that we may know His supreme love. That we may follow Him, like He followed His Heavenly Father, even though, He was God! That His love may compels us to obey God, as Jesus obeyed God, even though He was still God!\n Live Like Jesus Christ # Start by knowing God\u0026rsquo;s written word. There is so much extensive wisdom and knowledge about God, about human nature, and about God\u0026rsquo;s dealings with mankind and vice-versa. Take some time to learn how to study the Bible, and then do it, study it.\nBy having God\u0026rsquo;s spirit within you. Jesus started his ministry off by being baptized and the Holy Spirit came upon him. We human beings are all spiritual creatures; we have a body and we have a soul, but our spirit, our essence, is what will live on forever. Without God\u0026rsquo;s spirit living within us, we are dead, we cannot live. God\u0026rsquo;s spirit is what teaches us His will, He is what gives us joy in difficult times, and God\u0026rsquo;s spirit is the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead! The very notion of being \u0026ldquo;saved\u0026rdquo;, or being given eternal life, is identified by being reconciled with God, which ultimately means having God\u0026rsquo;s spirit. By having God\u0026rsquo;s spirit, we become a new creature, we are born again.\nBy understanding the intentions of Jesus through understanding His actions and His words. Jesus said and did many things, but he did none of it haphazardly, everything Jesus said or did was deliberate and profoundly intentional in the part it played or would play in the eternal scope of the whole universe. You cannot imitate Jesus if you have no idea what his objectives were. So study His words and His intentions carefully.\nBy doing everything that Jesus instructed his disciples to do. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what those things are, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to study. But we can always revert back again to the same fundamental principle, that Jesus said that all the law and prophets rest on two key commandments:\n Love God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. And, Love your neighbor as yourself.  But Jesus empowered his disciples through the Holy Spirit to lay hands on the sick and heal them, to cast out demons, and more. They were expected to do these things in love. It’s all always about love. Remember this, because it was reemphasized later in the New Testament especially by Paul, that nothing we do is meaningful or of any value without love.\nIf I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. (1 Corinthians 13:12)\nJesus Can Be Your Best Friend # When Jesus (God) was on this earth He was known as \u0026ldquo;friend of sinners,\u0026rdquo; and in a careful study of the context where these words are used, you will hardly find them as a compliment or a political slogan to win any kind of leadership position in the government or the \u0026ldquo;official religious denomination\u0026rdquo; he was a part of. If his name would have been put on a ballot to be President of the Jerusalem General Conference he would have not only been defeated, but would have gotten the lowest vote from the conservative majority controlling the denomination.\nThe precise phrase — “friend of sinners” — is mentioned twice in the Gospels, in Matthew 11:19 and Luke 7:34. The religiously conservative leadership of the denomination criticized Jesus as a “glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors, prostitutes, and sinners.” I doubt a Pastor today would be called to Pastor a Church in any denomination with those rumors on his background.\nThere is something you need to understand about this label: Friend of sinners. It has a double application.\nYes, in a general sense, Jesus is a \u0026ldquo;friend of all sinners.\u0026rdquo; No doubt about it. We are all sinners.\nBut the specific application of the Gospels and the pronouncement by the church leaders was a very negative, toxic, demeaning label.\nIt was a way to say This Jesus, is a friend of losers, people the church does not want to deal with, people who had committed sins on the list of intolerable sins. Remember the church had two lists of sins. Jesus went against that theology, and consistently chose the worst sinners!\nIncluded in that group were the homeless, women, the ones who suffered discrimination, the illegal aliens, the prostitutes, the ones considered cursed with disease, the LGTBQ, the publicans, (the ones who contracted the illegal aliens to work for the government at low wages), demon possessed people, mentally ill inhabiting cemeteries, the beggars, the tax collectors, (the ones who betrayed their people by collecting taxes for the oppressing government and often cheated them by vast amounts of money on illegal fees they pocketed), and kids. He was a FRIEND of the people at the margins of the culture. They loved Him. The official church hated them and Him. What a contrast!\nJesus was a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; of these people. He was not a social activist. He never marched on the streets for these people. He never carried banners or organized a revolt. He never fought the establishment. HE WAS THEIR FRIEND! He ate with them. He performed miracles for them. These were not the \u0026ldquo;average sinners,\u0026rdquo; but the outcasts of the culture. His own disciples were not a good sample of enlightened smart leadership. Jesus took as a leader a third position regarding these \u0026ldquo;sinners\u0026rdquo;: 1) He did not promote their \u0026ldquo;sins, and dysfunctions,\u0026rdquo; 2) Jesus did not judge their \u0026ldquo;sins and conditions.\u0026rdquo; 3) HE WAS THEIR FRIEND!\nMembers of the General Conference Jewish leadership establishment were appalled that Jesus would hang out with this \u0026ldquo;kind\u0026rdquo; of sinners.\nIf Jesus would have chosen to attend the last session of the General Conference of the SDA Church in San Antonio, he would have not been invited to preach. Imagine. No credentials. No ordination. No Andrews seminary. No track record of working with leaders. He would have been on the streets of San Antonio, performing miracles, and mingling with the losers at Starbucks, drinking coffee, or eating regular meat at a McDonalds. All that without permission from Ted Wilson. That would have been enough to outrage a lot of people and cause a commotion like you have never imagined. Perhaps He would have had to leave the city in a hurry. Don\u0026rsquo;t kid yourself. The same would happen with a Mormon Convention in Sal Lake City, or the Southern Baptist Convention. This is not unique of a denomination. It\u0026rsquo;s a classic of the corporate Christian religion. (One of the 5 religions of the world). I have a sneaky suspicion that Hindus and Buddhists would treat him better! :-) I don\u0026rsquo;t know why! Lol!\nJesus never compromised—Jesus was fully God in the flesh living on earth. But, here is my point, He loved those outcasts, this off-scouring of society, and they knew that He loved them. They followed Him. They were drawn by His love just like moths are drawn to a Coleman lantern in the middle of the wilderness. Amazing!\nMany, many members of the Christian religion have some very interesting ideas of the time of the end. \u0026ldquo;Persecution\u0026rdquo; always seems to comes up. There are so many charts on the way things will happen\u0026hellip;\nI have a feeling that \u0026ldquo;persecution\u0026rdquo; won\u0026rsquo;t happen the way it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;supposed\u0026rdquo; to happen. Mostly because Jesus said it would be a sudden end, like in the days of Noah, or a thief showing up in the middle of the night. Can you imagine a religious Christian saying, \u0026ldquo;Wait, wait Jesus\u0026hellip; Where is that in my chart? Not fair!\u0026rdquo; :-)\nYes, there will be a major religio-political movement at the end that will divide the world in two. But the \u0026ldquo;real persecution\u0026rdquo; of followers of God (I am convinced) will happen for God\u0026rsquo;s people standing up for \u0026ldquo;sinners.\u0026rdquo; The ones religion calls \u0026ldquo;bad sinners.\u0026rdquo; God is not a Christian, a Seventh-Day Adventist, a Baptist or a Jew. God is not involved in doctrinal debates. God\u0026rsquo;s business is LOVE, grace, redemption, salvation, eternal life. That is His consuming passion.\nLet me finish with this though. The final condition of the world in the end time was pronounced by Jesus in Matthew 24:12 (The Message)\n“In the CONFUSION, 1) lying preachers (False religion) will come forward and deceive a lot of people. For many others, 2) the overwhelming spread of evil will do them in (Chaotic conditions in the world. Crime. Climate change. Poverty. Hunger. Disease. Geopolitical conflict)—3) NOTHING LEFT OF THEIR LOVE but a mound of ashes.\u0026rdquo;\nPeople will be unable to love and be loved based on # 1 and # 2, Mark this: People will increasingly lose their ability to LOVE. The world will turn into a cold, cruel, unloving place. Religion has never been about love. No answers coming from that corner. Politics is not about loving. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect love from politicians.\nThere is one \u0026ldquo;remnant,\u0026rdquo; one group of people from all walks of life, from all religions of the world that will manifest the true character of God. It won\u0026rsquo;t be a RELIGION. It won\u0026rsquo;t be a denomination. It will be people who have let God love them, and have developed a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD translated into acts of LOVE for people, their marriages, their families, sinners and the marginal people of the culture. John 13: 35 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;This IS HOW EVERYONE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE MY FOLLOWERS—when they see the love you have for each other.” Followers of God in the time of the end will be known as FRIENDS OF SINNERS! A community of love. An accepting community. A community of inclusion not exclusion. Those people will be persecuted like Jesus was. Make no mistake!\nYou see, Friends? Lovers don\u0026rsquo;t need sermons on the observance of the 10 commandments. They will obey. Lovers will do what God asks because LOVE will be their driving force. Observance of the commandments of God, dogmas, doctrines, 38 fundamental beliefs, without LOVE are a total abomination to the existential nature of God\u0026rsquo;s existence: LOVE. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how great things you can do without love, (1 Corinthians 1:1-3), and the end God says, It\u0026rsquo;s NOTHING! No value. Waste of time, energy and resources.\nLearn to be a \u0026ldquo;friend of sinners\u0026rdquo; in Glendale, in Southern California, wherever you live.\n1) Learn to be ok with people from the margins of the culture, for God is there!\n2) Aim to LOVE, listen, affirm, really listen, not just be NICE to feel good about yourself. I became homeless with my 4 kids for 2 months several years ago. My life has never been the same since then. I talk to homeless people all the time, and I hear their deeper stories. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing what some of these people have gone through and what they know already of the grace of God. Listen to the girls of the night, the ones who are high on drugs, the ones struggling with alcohol. Listen\u0026hellip; Listen\u0026hellip;\n3) Pray for them. You may never see them again, But you don\u0026rsquo;t know how God may answer your prayer.\nHow many people from the margins of the culture will be in heaven because you became a friend of sinners? Is there any other purpose for our lives on this earth? Let GOD LOVE you FIRST, Friend, then LEAD life from within!\n"}).add({id:10,href:"/docs/book/salvation/",title:"Salvation is Free",description:"Feeling Lost? # \u0026ldquo;Suppose one of you had a hundred sheep and lost one.

Some would say no. But I beg to differ. I think heaven and God\u0026rsquo;s creatures in other planets that have not sinned are aware of what is happening on earth.\nHowever, I don\u0026rsquo;t think our loved ones are sitting in heaven, watching everything we do. But I do believe the angels and inhabitants of \u0026ldquo;unfallen\u0026rdquo; planets know what is going on, and there are verses that I could cite to prove that point. (Revelation 5: 13, 14) But this much I know CLEARLY: When someone surrenders to God and they repent of their sinful condition, there is REJOICING in heaven. Whenever there is a CONVERSION on earth, there is PARTYING in heaven. That, I know without a doubt!\nGod gets excited when LOST PEOPLE accept Him and repent of their LIFE WITHOUT GOD, and so should we. As C. S. Lewis said, Joy is the serious business of heaven. So if they are having a party in heaven over the conversion of one person, should we, too, not be excited when we see someone come to Christ?\nI believe that is what kept Jesus going, even to the cross, when He was on this earth! Hebrews 12:2 tells us that Jesus, \u0026ldquo;for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u0026rdquo; What was that joy? It was us. We were the joy. We were the prize. We were the treasure. We were the goal He went after and laid it all down for.\nI want to leave a thought with you\u0026hellip;\nCould it be that we find it difficult to rejoice over a lost person coming to God because we really don\u0026rsquo;t know what it means to be lost? Could it be that religion and culture have confused us so badly that we don\u0026rsquo;t understand that \u0026ldquo;NICE\u0026rdquo; people, \u0026ldquo;MORAL\u0026rdquo; people, \u0026ldquo;COMMANDMENTS OBEYING\u0026rdquo; people,\u0026ldquo;HELPFUL\u0026rdquo; people, people with a \u0026ldquo;GOOD HEART\u0026rdquo; may be as lost throughout eternity as what we label \u0026ldquo;BAD PEOPLE\u0026rdquo;?\nBeing spiritually lost, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean being a horrible person, or a horrible sinner, committing horrible crimes, serious offenses, or a serial killer! SPIRITUALLY LOST means being OK without God! It means being OK with religion! It means God is not at the center of your life! It means God is not a relationship that is renewing you every day! It means you fulfill a religious duty once a week, or even daily, but God is not the driving force of your life! And, perhaps, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference between your good life and a life with God or a life without God! Isn\u0026rsquo;t that tragic?\nWhat matters most to God, Friend, is your relationship with Him. What matters most to God about your wife, your husband, your children, your friends, your co-workers, people in the community, is their relationship with God. Eternity is on the balance! And you are God\u0026rsquo;s messenger to them! If you don\u0026rsquo;t know the difference between being saved and being lost, you probably can not see the difference in others either!\nPower of Grace # Grace in the Bible is the undeserved gift of eternal life, (John 3: 16, 17-The Message) God grants to a human being who accepts his sinful condition, and accepts Jesus as His Redeemer.\nEphesians 2:7-10 (The Message) is one of the most liberating messages of the Bible. It dismantles RELIGION totally! I call it the \u0026ldquo;RELIGION DEMOLITION\u0026rdquo; message directly from the heart of God. ([My notes]\n\u0026ldquo;Now God has [YOU] where he wants [YOU],\nwith all the time in this world and the next [God has all the time in the world. There is NO anxiety! God\u0026rsquo;s journey begins with REST! No hurry]\nto shower grace and kindness upon [YOU] in Christ Jesus.\nSaving is all his idea, and all his work. [No religion, theologian or denomination can claim this one. IT\u0026rsquo;S ALL GOD\u0026rsquo;S IDEA]\nAll we do is trust him enough to LET HIM DO IT.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s God\u0026rsquo;s gift from start to finish! We don\u0026rsquo;t play the major role. If we did, we\u0026rsquo;d probably go around bragging that we\u0026rsquo;d done the whole thing!\nNo, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving. He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing.\u0026rdquo;\nDid you know that “Grace” (The Gift of God, salvation, eternal life) is harder to accept than to reject it? It sounds crazy, uh? Sin has impacted our psyche in such a way that we struggle to accept love and grace. We have such a low concept of ourselves that we constantly find it easier to give, produce, work for something, and get a reward for it, than it is to accept anything because we are LOVED. We don’t know what to do with undeserved love!\nReligious people have made it to appear that the narrow gate is so because of demands God places on us, which are very tedious to fulfill. Like the BIG 10! Right? Have you heard that view in religious circles? It sounds like you have to jump on a behavioral treadmill, and try to be perfect, keep trying and trying… because otherwise you will miss heaven or paradise. All the religions of the world teach this view, except God Himself. All religions are rooted in a reward system based on good or bad behavior. Did you know that?\nThe narrow gate is so, because it requires you to leave all your human baggage at the door! Can you see the image? The door is narrow, you can not fit through it with your big luggage!\nJesus reduced the BIG 10 to 2, and the 2 to 1: LOVE. (Matthew 22: 37, 38-The Message) You can not love God, yourself, or people, unless you accept the love of God, first! You can not keep the BIG 10 unless you learn to love from God Himself! (1 John 4: 19-The Message) The human attempt to obey God is human baggage at the door!\nBy human baggage I imply all of your GOOD and BAD deeds. All your goodness, intentions, resolutions, and EFFORTS to be good! The narrow gate requires freedom from human baggage, that can only be found in God! Surrendering is the answer to the challenge of the “narrow gate,” not trying to obey God! When you surrender to God, He transforms your heart, your tendencies, and you find yourself obeying God, and responding to life like He would!\nSINNERS, who accept God in their lives, (Read the parable of the prodigal son, Luke 15: 11-32) make it easier through the narrow door, than religious people with all their attempts to be good and better.\nAmazing Grace! Have you experienced the GRACE of God in your life?\nThe Invitation # The Bible says about the human nature in Romans 3: 10-12 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;There’s NOBODY living right, NOT EVEN ONE, NOBODY who knows the score, NOBODY ALERT FOR GOD. They\u0026rsquo;ve ALL taken the wrong turn; they\u0026rsquo;ve ALL wandered down blind alleys. NO ONE\u0026rsquo;S living right; I can’t find A SINGLE ONE. Their throats are gaping graves, their tongues slick as mudslides. Every word they speak is tinged with poison. They open their mouths and pollute the air. They race for the honor of sinner-of-the-year, litter the land with heartbreak and ruin. DON\u0026rsquo;T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT LIVING WITH OTHERS. They never give God the time of day.\u0026rdquo;\nDo you struggle with your marriage? The reason is because you are broken. We all are. Relationships are troubled an conflicted. We don\u0026rsquo;t know the first thing about living with others, says God! You may be very religious, but lousy at relationships. We all are! We are control freaks by nature. We hurt people with our words, our tone of voice, our selfishness, our judgments. Our reactions are like knives on the throats of others.\nThe human condition is sick, fragmented and broken, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t recognize it.\nSo, the final question, the bottom line, is not whether you need God or not, but whether you acknowledge you need God or not!\nHave you been trying hard to be good? Are you exhausted? Tired of trying to do better? See yourself failing over and over again? Do see glimpses of your brokenness here and there?\nHere is Jesus\u0026rsquo;s invitation to you and me:\n\u0026ldquo;Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and lightly.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 11: 28-30 (The Message)\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s your bottom line? Are you open to God? If not, why not?\nWhat is the TRUTH of any matter?\nTruth is most often used to mean in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or to a standard or ideal.\nThe commonly understood opposite of truth is falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy and religion. Many human activities depend upon the concept, which is assumed rather than a subject of discussion, including science, law, and everyday life.\nVarious theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars and philosophers. Language and words are a means by which humans convey information to one another and the method used to determine what is a \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; is termed a criterion of truth.\nThere are differing claims on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are truthbearers capable of being true or false; how to define and identify truth; the roles that revealed and acquired knowledge play; and whether truth is subjective or objective, relative or absolute.\nMany religions consider perfect knowledge of all truth about all things (omniscience) to be an attribute of a divine or supernatural being.\nJesus was amazingly powerful in his definition of TRUTH. Out of context, it could perhaps be considered the most arrogant statement of all times. No one ever claimed this definition of truth.\nJesus was either God, or He was the greatest deceiver that ever walked on the face of the planet.\nJohn 14: 6 - \u0026ldquo;Jesus said, I am the truth!\u0026rdquo;\nJesus proposition is simple when it comes to spiritual \u0026ldquo;truth.\u0026rdquo; Spiritual or religious truth is not a set of dogmas, doctrines, theological statements, presuppositions, discoveries, but ONLY relational. No one has ever claimed this so poignantly. Of course there have been \u0026ldquo;masters,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;sages,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;wise men,\u0026rdquo; through the ages that pointed to the fact that by \u0026ldquo;association\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;discipleship\u0026rdquo; we could learn their \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;bigger truth.\u0026rdquo; But Jesus doesn\u0026rsquo;t say any of it. He simple say, \u0026ldquo;I, am the TRUTH!\u0026rdquo; Jesus is God! In other words, \u0026ldquo;Truth can only be found relationally as we get to know God!\u0026rdquo;\nWant TRUTH? Walk with God. Spend time reading your Bible. Spent time praying. Spend time meditating. Spend time sharing God with people. Every time you spend time WITH God, doing what He DOES, reaching people for the Kingdom, LOVING, feeding the poor, listening to people, affirming them, loving them, you are actually KNOWING TRUTH! Isn\u0026rsquo;t that a fascinating paradigm?\nSpend time with Jesus, reaching people for the Kingdom, following God\u0026rsquo;s passion, and you will know TRUTH!\nTRUTH is always relational when it comes to God. Doing your own religious things and trying to discover truth in the Bible is really a waste of time. You know who said that? Jesus!\n“You have your heads in your Bibles constantly because you think you’ll find eternal life there. But you miss the forest for the trees. These Scriptures are all about me! And here I am, standing right before you, and you aren\u0026rsquo;t willing to receive from me the life you say you want.\u0026quot; John 5: 39-40 (The Message)\n"}).add({id:11,href:"/docs/book/the-cross/",title:"Suffering and The Cross",description:"\u0026ldquo;IT IS FINISHED!\u0026rdquo; (John 19:30)\nThese are the most important words in the Bible.

When a follower of God understands the real meaning of those words the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus become an epiphany of glory and praise!\nThe cross was the goal of Jesus from the time He was born in Bethlehem by a miracle of God. His birth was so there would be His death. \u0026ldquo;Immanuel,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;God with us,\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 1: 23) was made possible for you and me. And here is the bottom line of the incredible, beyond words, passionate love of God for you and me: Jesus, God in human form, was born to die, so that you and I might live. And when He had accomplished the purpose He had come to fulfill, He summed it up in these 3 words: \u0026ldquo;It is finished!\u0026rdquo;\nIn the original Greek, it was a common word. Joseph probably used it after He finished a project that He and Jesus might have been working on together in the carpentry shop. Joseph might have turned to Jesus and said, \u0026ldquo;It is finished. Now let\u0026rsquo;s go have lunch.\u0026rdquo; It is finished. Mission accomplished. It is done.\nSO WHAT WAS FINISHED ON THE CROSS?\n  THE SUFFERING OF JESUS. Finished and completed were the horrendous sufferings of Christ. Never again would He experience pain at the hand of wicked men. Never again would He have to bear the sins of the world. Never again would He, even for a moment, be forsaken of God. That was completed. That was taken care of.\n  THE POWER OF THE DEVIL. Also finished was Satan\u0026rsquo;s stronghold on humanity. Jesus came to deal a decisive blow against the devil and his demons at the cross of Calvary. Hebrews 2:14 says, \u0026ldquo;Only by dying could he break the power of the devil, who had the power of death.\u0026rdquo; This means that you no longer have to be under the power of sin. Because of Jesus\u0026rsquo; accomplishment at the cross, finished was the stronghold of Satan on humanity. Satan and his demons were defeated for ever! The devil has no control over your life, ever, unless you allow it. God has you covered!\n  THE POWER OF SIN OVER YOU. And lastly, finished was our salvation. It is completed. It is done. All of our sins were transferred to Jesus when He hung on the cross. His perfect life was transferred to our account.\n  There are two standards of goodness while we are in this world. One is the standard of religion, culture and society, which is primarily based on observable behavior. The other is God\u0026rsquo;s standard that is based on the state of your heart. If your heart is God\u0026rsquo;s even though people may point their fingers at your faults and shortcomings, God says, \u0026ldquo;He/she is covered by me! He/she is my child!\u0026rdquo; The devil has no control over you when you surrender to God. The growth and the changes you experience in your life are the result of God\u0026rsquo;s presence in your life not some religious or psychological gimmicks of improved behavior.\nTwo days followed that incredible Friday evening after Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;It is finished\u0026rdquo;\nTHE SABBATH! The Sabbath was not just a day. It had been a whole symbol since the first week of creation. The Sabbath was as much an act of creation as what God created in the 6 days prior to creating the Sabbath! The Sabbath was actually created to celebrate the creation of the other 6 days.\nThat day had not been changed since the beginning of Creation. The Sabbath was created by God at the beginning, to commemorate His CREATION, and when Jesus died, Sabbath was the day of rest from the work of RE-CREATION! Jesus did not die on Friday by coincidence. The entire weekend was planned by God since the times of eternity with a purpose! The symbol of the Sabbath as a day of REST can not be underestimated. Sabbath, the 7th day of the week, means you and I can rest from the concerns of our eternal destiny. There is nothing more glorious and fantastic than that! When you chose to follow God, every Sabbath reminds you that God is your Creator and Re-Creator\u0026hellip; and it also reminds you that you can have a PEACE that no human strategy or earthly good can give you.\nThen came the first day of the week as it was called then!\nAs the Sabbath was a seal that the work of God was finished on behalf of the human race, the resurrection morning was a window into the power of God to keep His word. He promised salvation\u0026hellip; He promised eternal life\u0026hellip; He promised power to overcome the obstacles of this life, and He proved it by bringing Jesus back to life! Jesus went back to heaven with a human body like yours and mine to remind the entire universe that God\u0026rsquo;s character was in harmony with the spirit of His creation on this planet.\nLet me share a personal thought with you. There is no greater contradiction than the religious notion that God is waiting for you to become a good person! When someone says, \u0026ldquo;I am a good person, why do I need God?\u0026rdquo; he/she is simply devaluing the only \u0026ldquo;goodness\u0026rdquo; that matters in the eyes of God. When someone says, \u0026ldquo;I am OK, but I am trying to be better to make it to heaven\u0026rdquo; it must sound like an insult to the ears of a God that gave it ALL so you could be certain of your destiny. \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s goodness\u0026rdquo; is way greater than any self-generated human goodness. Good people, without God, do not understand the true nature of sin. Get this, friend\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;SIN\u0026rdquo; is not the opposite of \u0026ldquo;GOOD.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s what religion and morality has made you believe! \u0026ldquo;SIN\u0026rdquo; is being good or bad, apart from God! It is as simple as that! Human goodness means nothing in the eyes of God!\nThe message of Jesus on the cross, \u0026ldquo;IT IS FINISHED\u0026rdquo; means that nothing can be done to improve the perfect work of God done for humanity. People will not go to heaven or hell on the basis of their goodness, but by accepting God in their lives as the only source of PERFECTION.\nGod has shown His power to transform death into life\u0026hellip; Scars into stars\u0026hellip; He has given clear evidence that He is powerful to overcome Satan and the demons\u0026hellip; God, the Creator of the Universe is on your side, and He is victorious forever and ever! When you surrender your life to God, He looks at you and all He sees is a \u0026ldquo;PERFECT\u0026rdquo; person walking in a sinful world for a while.\nThere is no better GOOD NEWS anywhere else!\nJesus said that if we are to truly be His disciple, we are to “take up our cross daily and follow Him” (Luke 9:23).\nBut what does that mean?\nTo understand that, we need to understand the meaning of the cross in that time and culture. The cross has lost most of its original meaning today. It is shrouded in religiousness and mystery. It has become many things, from a religious icon to a fashion element.\nWhen we see the cross today, it is a symbol of faith—particularly the Christian faith. But understand this, Friend. When Jesus said the words of Luke 9:23, He had not yet died on the cross. So, Jesus knew by cultural contextual reference, that the cross was a symbol of death. In fact, it was the symbol of a very cruel death. The Romans reserved it for the worst criminals. It was a form of torture and humiliation, ultimately leading to a long and painful death. Jesus knew that was coming to Him. And chose to speak to His disciples about the mark of His true followers. “Take up your cross and follow me!\u0026quot;\nWhy would Jesus use the cross to illustrate what it meant to follow Him?\nJesus intentionally used a gruesome symbol to get the people’s attention. He did this to say that following Him was not “child’s play.” It is not a game and IT IS NOT EASY. In fact, it will cost you to follow Him as a disciple. But, on the other hand, it will cost you more not to follow Him. There is a cost involved in being a disciple of Jesus!\nWhat does it mean to “bear the cross” today?\nOften, we hear people say that they have a “cross” to bear. They will say, “My cross is my parents!” Their parents would probably say, “Our cross is our children!” They identify whatever problem or obstacle they have as their “cross to bear.” But that is not what the cross means.\nThe cross symbolizes one thing: dying to self.\nIt really is a paradox: by “dying to self,” or “losing yourself,” you “find yourself.” Through death, you find real life. Matthew 10:39\nWhat does it mean to “die to self”?\nI realize that the whole concept of “dying to self” is so counter-intuitive to what our culture stands for. “Die to self” when you can leave your spouse and move on to a better temporary condition? “Die to self” when you are being taught that the person with the most toys wins? Not a popular statement by any stretch of the imagination. It is not the problem, or the challenge you face that becomes the cross you bear. It’s your reaction to the challenge. Do you get up and keep fighting in our power? Or do you die to self and surrender to God? That is the paradox of the cross! Allow me to give you a few practical examples of how this would work in day-to-day living.\nTo bear the cross means forgiving, instead of harboring that grudge or giving in to the possibility to get even! Has someone hurt you badly? Do you dream with revenge? Forgiving means dying to self. That’s the cross Jesus invites you to carry!\nIt means resisting that temptation to do what everybody else does. Standing alone in the midst of a crowd that is walking in one direction, when God says to you, “No. I want you to go this way!” That kind of obedience requires dying to self.\nIt means putting down the remote control and picking up your Bible. Or it means to stop watching the movie, the show, that fills your mind with unreal scenes of sensuality, and reading your Bible instead. Unless you die to self, you won’t be willing to do that! The Bible is nor emotional enough for your senses!\nIt means praying when you would rather be talking to a friend, watching TV, doing something else. Setting time for God in the secret chamber of your mind requires dying to self. There is always something more “fun” to do than praying! The 30 minute drive to work… you immediately turn the radio on… You need noise to survive boredom! Unless you die to self, it won’t occur to you that those 30 minutes you could be talking to God.\nIt means “swallowing your pride” and telling someone about Jesus. I am convinced that followers of God can not witness unless they die to self. I have watched Christians for years… They are ashamed to talk to people about God? Why? Their self is alive! It’s scary!\nIt means doing what God wants you to do, instead of what you want to do. This is a tough one. Because the moments when God speaks to us, can be split seconds, and if you did not hear God, it’s gone! Your brain is wired to do what you want to do. Did you know that, Friend?\nTo die to self requires a rewiring of your old brain, by the power and the presence of God in your life.\nNow let me ask you, Friend “Are you dying to yourself and taking up the cross?” Is your religion huge in emotions, and short in authentic faith? Is your walk with God based on your moods and an emotional response or based on principles? Is your walk with God superficial, or do you get into the Word, and pray like your life depends on it?\nCarrying the cross and dying to self is not an option for followers of Christ. It is a commandment. It is a duty. You don’t wait to feel good about it before you actually obey. You obey first, then you will experience joy and overflowing life!\nThis is the crux of the problem for many followers of God. They want to carry the cross, when they find a better spouse, or when they have more money, or when they feel like their life is on the right track. All to the contrary. The call to obedience is to take up your cross, whatever it might be, and die to self.\n“The Warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought.\u0026quot; E.G.White, Steps to Christ, p. 27\nPaul summed it up well when he wrote: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me” (Galatians 2:20).\nJesus paradoxical statements can sound pretty unappealing. Let me get practical here.\nYou imagine yourself living in this miserable, sacrificial, unhappy condition, letting go of self and ending in the Mojave dessert hoping you can find yourself. But the fact of the matter is that nothing could be further from the truth. Note that Jesus says, “For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it!” Think of it as “God’s trade-in plan.”\nI can not tell you how many times i have heard a man or a woman telling me that they are divorcing or separating because they need to “find themselves.” Excuse me? (By the way, I can’t stand that expression. 99% of the time it is an excuse for not choosing to love, or choosing to hide an affair) One makes that statement usually before doing something really selfish, like walking out on a marriage. They might say, “You are no longer meeting my needs. I am unhappy, so I am going to leave you because I need to find myself!” Amazing!\nCould anything be more cliché, and wrong?\nIn essence, Jesus says, “You want to find yourself? Then lose yourself.\u0026quot;\nDo you want to find life, purpose, and personal happiness? Then say, “Lord, here is my life, I surrender my plans, my aspirations, my dreams, as well as my weaknesses, shortcomings, and sins. I believe that Your plans are better than mine in the long run.\u0026quot; Surrendering to God is the way to let go of your life, and allowing God to give you a life blessed by Him.\nBut what does it mean to “take up our cross and follow Him?” This is explained in Luke 13:33: “Whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple.\u0026quot; Literally, this means: “You must surrender your claim to everything and say goodbye to being in control.”\nThat does not mean that to live as a disciple of Jesus one has to take a vow of poverty and give every possession away. Jesus meant that we are to surrender our claim to our possessions. In other words, we are not to be possessed by possessions.\nIt’s fine to have clothes, a car, a house, and a career. It’s fine to have friends, hobbies, and interests. But the true disciple should not be obsessed with these things. The only obsession a disciple should have is for Jesus Christ. He must be the most important pursuit in our lives. He must be more important than our career or our personal happiness.\nThe fact is we will find the personal happiness we want not by seeking it, but by seeking Him.\nWould you choose to do that today, Friend?\nIt could be letting go of anger… desire for vengeance… resentment… control over the affairs of your life… welcome interruptions with an open attitude… God may have something in store for you that you have no way to see right now…\n“For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it” (Luke 9:23–24).\nIt may be letting of your expectations for a the marriage of your dreams. It may be letting go of your dreams to retire early and for some reason or other you find yourself not being able to retire. It may be someone betrayed you in a business transaction. Whatever the “cross” is… carry it in the name of Jesus, and God will bless you beyond your wildest imagination. This is the crux of the problem for many followers of God. They want to carry the cross, when they find a better spouse, or when they have more money, or when they feel like their life is on the right track. All to the contrary. The call to obedience is to take up your cross, whatever it might be, and die to self.\n\u0026ldquo;The Warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought.\u0026rdquo; E.G.White, Steps to Christ, p. 27\nPaul summed it up well when he wrote: \u0026ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me\u0026rdquo; (Galatians 2:20).\nPurpose of Suffering # Did you know God suffers with you? Did you know God keeps a record of your tears?\nThis is what the Bible says in Psalm 56:8, \u0026ldquo;You keep track of all my sorrows. YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL MY TEARS IN YOUR BOTTLE. YOU HAVE RECORDED EACH ONE IN YOUR BOOK.\u0026rdquo; Did you know that about God, Friend!\nIt is not wrong to cry. It is human. I feel sorry for people who can not cry. God keeps a record of our tears, because tears represent pain, suffering, losses, rejection, disappointments, betrayal, anger and longings.\n\u0026ldquo;Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\u0026rdquo; - C.S. Lewis\n1 Corinthians 13:12 (The Message) \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t yet see things clearly. We\u0026rsquo;re squinting in a fog, peering through a mist. But it won\u0026rsquo;t be long before the weather clears and the sun shines bright! We\u0026rsquo;ll see it all then, see it all as clearly as God sees us, knowing him directly just as he knows us!\u0026rdquo;\nIt is true that God takes a life that is empty, or full of irrelevant stuff, aimless, and headed toward hell, turns it around and transforms it by His magnificent power and presence. He forgives totally, 100% your sin condition. Once and forever you become free from the penalty of sin. Moreover, He credits the very righteousness of Jesus Christ into our \u0026ldquo;spiritual bank account.\u0026rdquo;\nThen He begins the work of transformation. He begins to remove guilt and shame, fear and darkness, addictions and toxic behavior, and fills the void with love, kindness, compassion and a sense of His presence.\nRomans 8:26-28 (The Message) \u0026ldquo;Meanwhile, the moment we get tired in the waiting, God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit is right alongside helping us along. IF WE DON\u0026rsquo;T KNOW HOW OR WHAT TO PRAY, IT DOESN\u0026rsquo;T MATTER. HE DOES OUR PRAYING IN AND FOR US, MAKING PRAYER OUR OF OUR WORDLESS SIGHS, our aching groans. He knows us far better than we know ourselves, knows our pregnant condition, and keeps us present before God. That\u0026rsquo;s why we can be so sure that EVERY DETAIL in our lives of love for God is worked into something good.\u0026rdquo;\nPsalm 136: 23-26 (The Message) \u0026ldquo;God remembered us when we were down, His love never quits. Rescued us from the trampling boot, His love never quits. Takes care of everyone in time of need. His love never quits. Thank God, who did it all! His love never quits!\u0026rdquo;\nThe very heart of the Gospel, the Messianic Good News, is contained in Isaiah 61 (NIV). 750 years plus BC, the prophet Isaiah predicted the words Jesus would use describing His mission. Luke 4:18-19. This is the reason why Jesus came to this world. To display the love of God before humanity and the universe. God promised to turn bad into good for His people!\n\u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God,\nto comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion—to bestow on them a CROWN OF BEAUTY INSTEAD OF ASHES, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you believe God is sovereign, you will never turn into a victim! I have wondered myself many times, why certain things are the way they are. Your feelings and emotions may betray you. People\u0026rsquo;s views may deceive you. But, if by faith, you firmly believe God is in control of every thing, you will rest in Him. You will give up the fight. You will receive the gift of the experiential \u0026ldquo;Sabbath,\u0026rdquo; (Rest in Hebrew) which is deeper than the simple legalistic observance of a weekly rest. I believe in the weekly observance totally, but the deeper meaning of the \u0026ldquo;Sabbath,\u0026rdquo; is a peace, a rest, that moves beyond what the human eye can see and reason can understand. It is the experience of trust in God. At peace with the disconnected pieces of this life\u0026rsquo;s puzzle.\nThis is the very point of differentiation between RELIGION and a RELATIONSHIP with God. Because God wills into a relationship with us, He sees, he suffers, He walks with us. Because He knows, He will turn all things according to His original purpose.\nDo you trust God? Do you believe God loves you? Then you know deep down in your heart, that God will bring all good things to happen to those who love Him. God wills into a relationship with us, He sees, he suffers, He walks with us. Because He knows, He will turn all things according to His original purpose.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t run from suffering; embrace it. Follow me and I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how. Self-help is no help at all. Self-sacrifice is the way, my way, to saving yourself, your true self. What good would it do to get everything you want and lose you, the real you? What could you ever trade your soul for?\u0026rdquo; Mark 8: 34-37-The Message\nShare with people today, the Good News of a loving God, as if their eternal lives would depend on you. Live and love today, as if this would be your last day on earth! Nothing matters most!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s absolutely true that when you trust Christ as Savior, and surrender to God, He removes a whole set of problems you used to have—including the nagging guilt, the shame, the fear, and that empty sense of aimlessness in life that used to haunt you.\nBut we need to understand something else.\nThis world is broken. People are broken. There are demonic forces driving people to hurt others. There is death, sickness, cancer, the drunk driver on the road, divorce, imperfect DNA, and all kind of maladies caused by SIN.\nI am all for positive messages of encouragement. I am all for the promises of God in the Bible, and the reward to faithfulness. I am all for \u0026ldquo;happy endings\u0026rdquo; even if not all stories on this earth have a \u0026ldquo;happy ending.\u0026rdquo; Jesus ended up on a cross. Jesus\u0026rsquo; disciples, all, except one were martyrs. They died violent deaths.\nI am a bit suspicious of preachers who make everything look so good, that you are not prepared for the tests that will come upon you as a follower of God.\nThe day you surrender to God and put your trust in Him, at that very precise second, you walk into an unknown battlefield—a warfare that will last for the rest of your life. There will be joy and happy moments for sure. But there will be fierce battles also. There will be cancer. There will be Columbines, there will be Sandy Hook Elementary School, there will be Auroras, and there will be the suffering of innocent people.\nWhy? Because not only is there a God who loves you with passion, and has a plan for your life, but there is also a devil who hates you, and fiercely opposes God\u0026rsquo;s plan. God will at times allow the devil to bring suffering into your life because that is His shaping tool to make you a citizen of His Kingdom. WE don\u0026rsquo;t have the answers now, why this person, and not that one. Why me, and not you. Or why you and not me.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a gospel that promises peace and plenty, but never warns of persecution. It\u0026rsquo;s a gospel that says God wants you to be healthy and wealthy, and never tells you you may become homeless. It\u0026rsquo;s a gospel that says you can so wrap yourself in God\u0026rsquo;s favor that there will always be enough money for what you need and want, a parking space available for you at the mall, and people will all smile and treat you like royalty.\nFriend, that is not the Good News of God. I can assure you, the last thing on Paul\u0026rsquo;s mind was, \u0026ldquo;How can win a lottery ticket? Or how can I make sure I have enough money to deal with the fiscal cliff? Or what kind of gun I should have in my house in case an intruder breaks in? How can I protect my family?\u0026rdquo; Paul instead said, \u0026ldquo;Endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.\u0026rdquo; The soldier Paul had in mind was not armed with guns and assault weapons. He was armed with the presence of God. Read Ephesians 6: 10-18.\nComparison with other followers of God, or people who brag of God\u0026rsquo;s blessings is a very dangerous game. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall for it.\nFirst of all, because so called \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo; that are forever claiming blessings, rewards and no \u0026ldquo;pain,\u0026rdquo; I am not sure are reading the same Bible I read. I say this with all respect. And second, because you don\u0026rsquo;t know God\u0026rsquo;s ways, you don\u0026rsquo;t know that person\u0026rsquo;s heart, you don\u0026rsquo;t know the end of the road. Only God knows it! God is in control of every event on this planet. But He is also in the business of shaping people for eternity.\nThe essence of the Christian life is knowing God, walking with Him, obeying Him, and enduring the trials and tribulations you face with Him by your side. Trusting him when things go good, and when things turn upside down. That\u0026rsquo;s it!\nFollowing God is about sticking with Him when the sky is blue, where the sun is out, and also when it\u0026rsquo;s filled with clouds or choked with smoke. It\u0026rsquo;s about walking with God through thick and thin, and pressing on through every heartache and trial that happens to come our way. It is about laughing hard, and crying bitter tears, like the parents of innocent kids in Connecticut, and the loved ones of those who were murdered brutally.\nJesus made it clear that storms will enter every life. Yours and mine.\nBut it is through these storms and hardships and tribulations that we will enter God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. Did you know that, Friend?\nLuke put it this way: \u0026ldquo;And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, \u0026lsquo;WE MUST THROUGH MANY TRIBULATIONS ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (Acts 14:21–22 NKJV).\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t always welcome a verse like this. It\u0026rsquo;s not a passage we would love to frame and put on the wall of our living room.\nWe would probably rather frame something that reads, \u0026ldquo;Through many days of perpetual happiness, joy, and pleasure we will enter the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; But that isn\u0026rsquo;t Scripture, and that isn\u0026rsquo;t life. Trials and tribulations will come no matter what.\nJob said: \u0026ldquo;Man who is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble\u0026rdquo; (Job 14:1 NKJV). Another version translates it like this: \u0026ldquo;How frail is man, how few his days, how full of trouble!\u0026rdquo; (TLB) This is so true!\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, (Matthew 7: 21-28), Jesus told a story about two men who built two homes. One of the builders erected his home on shifting sand by the beach. He had always dreamed with an ocean view. He finally got it. The other guy found a piece of property that was literally a huge rock. He built his house there. The foundations were the opposite of each other.\nTime went by, and the guy by the beach had a terrific time. The guy who built the house on the rock had to climb stairs and the house was not right there by the beach. But then the season of storms came. With the storms came the torrential rains, the strong winds, tornadoes, and the waves of the ocean hit the shore with extraordinary force. The storm hit both houses. The house built by the beach collapsed. The one built on the rock stood firm.\nThe obvious point of Jesus\u0026rsquo; story is that you and I must build our lives on a foundation that will last, like the one we find in the pages of God\u0026rsquo;s Word.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s an application we sometimes miss. The storm came to both lives. The wind beat on both houses. The rain poured on both building sites.\nThe man who was wise and carefully chose a stable foundation got hit with the same hurricane-force winds as the man who wanted instant gratification and wanted to make sure his friends would choose his house for parties. The view, the convenience of the water, the weather was all attractive at the moment.\nNo one is exempt from experiencing storms in life. Good things will happen to us, as well as tragic and inexplicable things. Every life will have its share of pain.\nAs much as we would like to believe otherwise, none of us can take an extended vacation beyond the reach of human suffering and tragedy.\nThe storms may be the same. Your loved one may die a horrible death. The difference between those who build their lives on God, and those who don\u0026rsquo;t, is that God is in control of the lives of those who trust Him. God can turn scars into stars. God can turn storms into renewed strength for the future. God can bring good out of evil, pain and suffering.\nThat is what my Bible teaches, and that is what I believe. I know it, because as I look at my own life I would have never imagined God would make me strong through the storms and the dark nights of life.\nRomans 8:28 was my dad\u0026rsquo;s favorite verse, and it was the one I read at his funeral a few months ago. He lived his 94 years by this verse. \u0026ldquo;And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose\u0026rdquo; (NKJV).\nA better translation would be, \u0026ldquo;He is causing all things to work and to continue working together for good.\u0026rdquo;\nPlease notice that this promise is only valid for followers of God.\nLife is a process and, as finite beings who live moment to moment, we can\u0026rsquo;t see around the bend. We can\u0026rsquo;t discern God\u0026rsquo;s ultimate purposes.\nBut we can know this: He is watching and caring—in control and loving us with an everlasting love.\n  Seek God in your personal life! Delight in Him. Remain in His Word and will for your life. You can not be using the world\u0026rsquo;s strategies to succeed in God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom. You can not be doing your own thing and expect God to come on board with you plan and bless you! He is not a piece of your plan. The big dream must be submitted to Him! You start with God and ask Him to reveal to you, the way He wants you to pursue it. He will do it!\n  Persevere. Don\u0026rsquo;t give up. This promise energizes me every time I read it. Lamentations 3: 25-33 (The Message)\n  \u0026ldquo;God proves to be good to the man WHO PASSIONATELY WAITS, to the woman who DILIGENTLY SEEKS. It\u0026rsquo;s a good thing to quietly hope, quietly hope for help from God. It\u0026rsquo;s a good thing when you\u0026rsquo;re young to stick it out through the hard times.\nWhen life is heavy and hard to take, go off by yourself. ENTER THE SILENCE. BOW IN PRAYER. DON\u0026rsquo;T ASK QUESTIONS: WAIT FOR HOPE TO APPEAR. Don\u0026rsquo;t run from trouble. Take it full-face. The \u0026ldquo;worst\u0026rdquo; is never the worst.\nWhy? Because the Master WON\u0026rsquo;T EVER WALK OUT AND FAIL TO RETURN. if he works severely, he also works tenderly. His stockpiles of loyal love are immense. He takes no pleasure in making life hard, in throwing roadblocks in the way.\u0026rdquo;\n"}).add({id:12,href:"/docs/book/let-god-love-you/",title:"Let God Love You",description:"Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

But as many as received Him (Jesus) to them, He gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in Him (John 1:12).\nWhen we come to God by faith and acknowledge our sins (our selfish ways, disobedience, our going our own way instead of His way), He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins, and not only that but to cleanse us of all unrighteousness. He transforms our spirits into new creatures, and we immediately enter into His eternal life as we submit to His holy presence.\nThe knowledge that God offers His love to you every hour of every day may not be new to you; what may be new is that you have to receive Him who is love or His loving forgiveness will not become yours. Generally, humanity gives and receives human love. That is because most people have not received God’s love. We cannot give something we do not have. It is vital in all of our lives that we receive God’s love so that we can love Him back and love those around us with His love. The essence of salvation is receiving God’s forgiveness, which is part of His love. So we begin by receiving His love. If we are born again, we have already received His loving forgiveness. At any time, we can open the door and ask Him to come in, even right now, you can simply tell Him that you want to know Him personally and live with Him forever, that you want to love and obey Him, that you know that Jesus paid the penalty for your sin on the cross and now offers you His loving forgiveness. Then out of simple faith in what God has said, open the door and receive Him. Receive His love, His forgiveness and the fullness of His Holy Spirit.\nIn order to be saved, we must have genuine faith. Faith is complete trust in something we can’t see but are certain of it because we believe it is true. Faith is not feelings or positive thinking. Faith is a gift from God.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t that amazing? God gives us everything we need for life for FREE if we would just say to God..\u0026ldquo;Yes, you are right!\u0026rdquo;\nNow faith is the certainty of things hoped for, a proof of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)\nAnd without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6)\nThe word “grace” means something which is given freely\u0026hellip;without cost or obligation. You cannot purchase eternal life with good works, right living. God is not for sale! Remember, God will offer it only as a gift to you if you truly want it! When man attempts to gain eternal life through his own works, he is no longer accepting God’s offer of eternal life as a free gift, that is, by Grace.\nWow is about having one\u0026rsquo;s mind blown away by the fascinating reality of the unexpected\u0026hellip; The small things\u0026hellip;\nGod\u0026rsquo;s grace is His infinite ability, driven by love, to SURVIVE my choices, my stupidity, my limitations, and suffer innocently as God, like I suffer innocently my sinful nature\u0026hellip; That was truly a \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; moment!\nIf you will humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, in His good time, He will lift you up (1 Peter 5:6)\nKnow that humility is also necessary to receive God’s love, to be lifted up by our heavenly Father. We must put aside the love and concern we have for ourselves to make room for the love of another. God’s love is all around us all the time. If we make room, He will surely come in. You may ask, “How can I control this ego of mine and humble myself so that I can receive God’s love?” Our ego doesn’t want to be dependent on anyone; it wants others to be dependent on us, so that we appear to be someone special. But there is only One who is not dependent on anyone and that is God. It is said that a humble person does not stoop smaller than he is; he stands at his real height seeing the reality of how small he is compared to God. When he humbles himself, he does not have to put on an act anymore because he has the real thing.\nHumility causes us to begin to fit into God’s kingdom and into the purpose He has for our lives which is fellowship with Himself. In trusting humility, we can open the door of our hearts and receive God’s love through a real, personal, loving relationship (Revelation 3:20). Then, through the power of His love, we have the strength to overcome our old sinful nature and love Him back. Because He loves us first, we are able to do our part and complete an exchange of love.\n\u0026ldquo;So here’s what I want you to do\u0026hellip;: Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering.\u0026rdquo; (as act of worship)\nLive your ordinary life as a Divine WOW because you are keenly aware of God\u0026rsquo;s presence in your collective consciousness and world around. In fact later on Paul makes a distinction between a dull, flat life lived according to the culture and the \u0026ldquo;WOW\u0026rdquo; experience God enables in your life from within.

Yet, the message of Jesus, reminds us that a simple life, lived in the presence of God is the only thing that really matters.\n“Don’t hoard TREASURE down here where it gets eaten by moths and corroded by rust or—worse!—stolen by burglars. Stockpile treasure in heaven, where it’s safe from moth and rust and burglars. It’s obvious, isn’t it? The place where your treasure is, is the place you will most want to be, and end up being. Matthew 6:19-34 (The Message)\n“Your eyes are windows into your body. If you open your eyes wide in wonder and belief, your body fills up with light. If you live squinty-eyed in greed and distrust, your body is a dank cellar. If you pull the blinds on your windows, what a dark life you will have! [Jesus is referring here to what gets your attention! What you focus on! YOUR MIND IS THE EYE, THE WINDOW, OF YOUR HEART-The center of your passion and emotions!]\n“You can’t worship two gods at once. Loving one god, you’ll end up hating the other. Adoration of one feeds contempt for the other. YOU CAN’T WORSHIP GOD AND MONEY BOTH [A better translation for money is MATERIALISM, that which keeps you busy pursuing money, power, and the tangible rewards of a busy life.]\n“IF YOU DECIDE FOR GOD,…it follows that you don’t fuss about what’s on the table at mealtimes or whether the clothes in your closet are in fashion. There is far more to your life than the food you put in your stomach, more to your outer appearance than the clothes you hang on your body.\nLook at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.\n“Has anyone by fussing in front of the mirror ever gotten taller by so much as an inch? All this time and money wasted on fashion—do you think it makes that much difference? Instead of looking at the fashions, walk out into the fields and look at the wildflowers. They never primp or shop, but have you ever seen color and design quite like it? The ten best-dressed men and women in the country look shabby alongside them.\n“If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers—most of which are never even seen—don’t you think he’ll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you?\nWhat I’m trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with GETTING, so you can RESPOND TO GOD’S GIVING.\nDon’t worry about missing out. You’ll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.\n“Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don’t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. GOD WILL HELP YOU DEAL WITH WHATEVER HARD THINGS COME UP WHEN THE TIMES COMES.\nThe most EMPOWERING presence for every POSITIVE CHOICE you make is God! Read these promises. Every time you make a POSITIVE CHOICE God is next to you, ready to assist you!\nFor God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline. (2 Timothy 1:7, NLT)\nI know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation…I can do all this through him who gives me strength.

LOVE is ultimately all we leave behind when our days on this earth come to an end.\nContentment # \u0026ldquo;I’ve LEARNED by now to be quite CONTENT whatever my circumstances. I’m just as happy with little as with much, with much as with little. I’ve found the recipe for being happy whether full or hungry, hands full or hands empty. Whatever I have, wherever I am, I can make it through anything in the One who makes me who I am.\u0026rdquo; Philippians 4: 11 (The Message)\nFor Paul to write that he was content in every situation is truly amazing. At the time of this writing, he was in jail in Rome. Charged with sedition, treason, and other serious crimes, he had appealed to the highest court: Caesar himself. Without other legal recourse and friends in high places, he had to wait for his case to be heard. It seems as if Paul had the right to be an impatient and unhappy person. Instead, he wrote to the Philippians to say that he had LEARNED to be content.\nContentment is not natural for any of us. The competitive spirit in us drives us to compare, to complain, to covet, and to seek vengeance. Few of us are in a predicament such as Paul’s, but we all face difficulties in which we can learn to trust God and be content.\nThe art of contentment is finally learned when we catch the fact that God is the fulfillment to all of our needs. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what it is. You can go to God and talk to him about what hurts you, bothers you, inconveniences you. He will hear you and fulfill the deepest needs of your heart. It\u0026rsquo;s a choice.

There is no unpardonable offense with God. Did you know that, Friend? Nothing, absolutely nothing is so offensive to God, that He can not forgive. Even rejecting Jesus as a historical presence on this planet, God will forgive! What has been called by religion “the only thing God will not forgive” is not really factually accurate. When a person who rejects God, walks away from God so far, by personal choice, that another 1 billion years wouldn’t make a difference because such individual is set against God, God let’s go! It’s not any more about forgiveness. It is all about a painful, merciful, graceful act of respect by God, to let go of such person! Hell is not so much punishment, but final act of grace and love for the one who would never accept God’s love, such as Lucifer and the demons. Hell is a final moment of mercy for people who have chosen to live a life of misery. Humans were never created to live without God. Are you with me, Friend? God forgives!\nJesus Himself said, (Matthew 22: 31,32-The Message)\n“There’s NOTHING or said that can’t be forgiven. But if you deliberately persist in your slanders against God’s Spirit, you are repudiating the very One who forgives. If you REJECT THE SON OF MAN out of some misunderstanding, the Holy Spirit can forgive you, BUT when you REJECT THE HOLY SPIRIT, you’re sawing off the branch on which you’re sitting, severing by your own perversity all connection with the One who forgives.\u0026quot;\nGod’s forgiveness is so passionate, intense and complete, that HE FORGETS. Imagine! No human being is able to forget a deep emotional injury! (Jeremiah 31: 34-Hebrews 8:11)\nJesus spoke a lot about forgiveness:\nHe said if we do not forgive we are simply revealing the absence of God in our lives. There are not excuses, DNA factors, temperamental pre-disposition of the depth of the offense. Matthew 6:15, says that if we do not forgive, we don’t belong in the Kingdom of God. God’s kingdom is about love!\nForgiveness or an unforgiving spirit is like a huge tree with deep roots in the heart. Here are some of the reasons why forgiveness is so important!\nTrue, authentic forgiveness says, you accept the human condition. The human condition is broken. All of us are messed up! Would you agree with me? Jesus said it bluntly when He was on the cross, talking about the people who betrayed Him, Judas, the CHURCH, those who pierced his hands and feet with nails! Luke 23: 34-The Message “Father, forgive them; THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.\u0026quot; If you can think of your offender and accept that they are human, at times possessed by evil forces, they don’t know what they are doing! If you accept this fact, YOU WILL AMAZINGLY BE ABLE TO FORGIVE!\nTrue, authentic forgiveness declares your dependance on God to fulfill your human needs. When a human let’s you down and you forgive, you are simply declaring that God is the source of your fulfillment. You deprive yourself of God’s abundant forgiveness when you say, “I won’t forgive this person, I will avenge myself, I will divorce the jerk, I will hurt the offender to teach her a lesson…” When you do that, you are walking on your own, and God doesn’t owe you anything! God respects your rebelliousness. God’s kingdom is a kingdom of LOVE not one of revenge!\nTrue, authentic forgiveness opens the gates for God to perform miracles! Did you know that, Friend? When you take the pressure off a human being, your offender, by the act of forgiving, you are tacitly telling God, “God, you take over!” Great story in Matthew 18:23-35-The Message\nTrue, authentic forgiveness is healing to your own soul. I have had the sad past experience to specifically ask forgiveness from 3 people for sins I committed against them. They chose not to forgive me! One said “NO” in front of a whole congregation, the other two said “yes” but their hurtful and vengeful behavior after the facts told me clearly I had to pay for what I did. I believe that an unforgiving spirit sickens the emotions, causes havoc in the brain and the immune system, destroys relationships, intoxicates the mind, and causes sickness. James 5: 16-The Message\nTrue, authentic forgiveness allows God to use the pain the offender inflicted on you to shape you according to His unique purpose for you. Last Saturday night I spoke about Joseph. God used the pain his brothers caused Him to shape him. God used the pain the King’s wife cause on him to shape him. The devil tried to destroy the “dreamer” in Joseph. God used the trials to take him to the top. I have memorized the words of Joseph, because that’s the way I feel about every one that has ever hurt me, and I pray that God will bless those I have hurt and have forgiven me with the heart. Genesis 50: 20-The Message Joseph replied, “Don’t be afraid. Do I act for God? Don’t you see, you planned EVIL against me BUT God used those SAME PLANS FOR MY GOOD, as you see all around you right now—life for many people. Easy now, you have nothing to fear; I’ll take care of you and your children.” He reassured them, speaking with them heart-to-heart. God developed an amazing heart of compassion in Joseph, during all those dark moments that tested His faith in God!\nWHAT GOD DOES NOT HEAL, OR SUPPLY IN YOUR LIFE, NO ONE, NOTHING WILL SATISFY EVER.

So the starting point, and the destination, of Jesus strategies, are both upside-down, counter culture modes of life.\nThe word Jesus uses through Matthew 5:3-12 is translated as \u0026ldquo;Blessed\u0026rdquo; which in the Greek is the word \u0026ldquo;makarios.\u0026rdquo; In ancient Greek times, \u0026ldquo;makarios\u0026rdquo; referred to the \u0026ldquo;gods.\u0026rdquo; The blessed ones were the \u0026ldquo;gods.\u0026rdquo; They had achieved a state of happiness and contentment in life that was beyond all cares, labors, and even death. The blessed ones were beings who lived in some other world away from the cares and problems and worries of ordinary people. To be blessed, you had to be a god. This is very important to understand the radical teaching of Jesus, Friend. \u0026ldquo;makarios\u0026rdquo; took on a second meaning. It referred to the \u0026ldquo;dead\u0026rdquo;. I know this may sound contradictory, but follow me for a minute. The blessed ones were humans, who, through death, had reached the other world of the gods. They were now beyond the cares and problems and worries of earthly life. To be \u0026ldquo;blessed\u0026rdquo; (\u0026quot;makarios.\u0026quot;) you either had to be a god, or you must have died and gone to live with the gods or become a god yourself. That is the origin of the different saints days \u0026ndash; they are remembered on the dates of their deaths. That\u0026rsquo;s when they reached their stated of \u0026ldquo;blessedness\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sainthood.\u0026rdquo; Finally, with the passing of time the Greek usage of the word \u0026ldquo;makarios\u0026rdquo; came to refer to the elite, the upper crust of society, the wealthy people. It referred to people whose riches and power put them above the normal cares and problems and worries of the lesser folk \u0026ndash; the peons, who constantly struggle and worry and labor in life. To be \u0026ldquo;blessed,\u0026rdquo; you had to be very rich and powerful. Isn\u0026rsquo;t what the culture defines as a successful life? Happiness? I hear stories every week from people who tell me, \u0026ldquo;I want to be happy.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I have the right to be happy.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I have worked hard all my life and now is the time to enjoy myself and be happy.\u0026rdquo; In other words, \u0026ldquo;I want to be above the hassles of ordinary life, and I just want to be free to do whatever I want.\u0026rdquo; The lure of that life style in our culture is huge! Why? Because we see celebrity and the cultural icons of society seemingly living that life of leisure and hedonistic pleasure. In Jesus thinking it not the elite who are blessed (\u0026quot;makarios\u0026quot;; the happy, successful, accomplished, above the care of this worlds because they have everything they need). It is not the rich and powerful who are blessed. It is not the high and mighty who are blessed. It is not the people living in huge mansions or expensive penthouses who are blessed. Rather, Jesus pronounces God\u0026rsquo;s blessings (Happinesss, success, joy, \u0026ldquo;makarios\u0026rdquo;) on the lowly, the poor, the hungry, the thirsty, the meek, those who mourn and grieve. Throughout the history of this word, it had always been the other people who were considered blessed: the rich, the filled up, the powerful.\nJesus turns it all upside-down. The elite in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, the blessed ones in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, the happy ones, the ones overflowing with joy, the successful ones are those who are at the bottom of the heap of humanity. Now, tell me something\u0026hellip; Isn\u0026rsquo;t this radical? Totally counter-culture?\nJesus called people who were at the edge of catastrophe, BLESSED! Did you know that? Imagine, if someone tells you, “I am dying of cancer…” And you say, “Well, you are blessed, because now, you will know something about the power and the peace of God, you have never known before!” It is hard to imagine that… Yet, that is exactly what Jesus said!\n“You’re blessed when YOU’RE AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE. With less of you there is more of God and his rule.\u0026quot;\n“You’re blessed when YOU FEEL YOU’VE LOST WHAT IS MOST DEAR TO YOU. Only then can you be embraced by the One most dear to you.\u0026quot;\n“You’re blessed when you’re content with just who you are—no more, no less. That’s the moment you find yourselves proud owners of everything that can’t be bought.\u0026quot;\n“You’re blessed when you’ve worked up a good appetite for God. He’s food and drink in the best meal you’ll ever eat.\u0026quot;\n“You’re blessed when you care. At the moment of being ‘care-full,’ you find yourselves cared for.\u0026quot;\n“You’re blessed when you get your inside world—your mind and heart—put right. Then you can see God in the outside world.\u0026quot;\n“You’re blessed when you can show people how to cooperate instead of compete or fight. That’s when you discover who you really are, and your place in God’s family.\u0026quot;\n“You’re blessed when your commitment to God provokes persecution. The persecution drives you even deeper into God’s kingdom.\u0026quot;\nAll these pronouncements from Jesus are describing extreme conditions in all aspects of life. Environmental, financial, emotional, relational, physical and spiritual conditions. God comes to the assistance and help of people who are at the END OF THEIR ROPE. That explains, by the way, the reason why Jesus\u0026rsquo; crowd, was mostly composed of common people, homeless, “sinners”, the sick, the mentally disturbed, people whom the culture looked down on!\nWhat we consider human failure, God calls OPPORTUNITY.\nWhat we call scars, God calls stars!\nWhat we call stumbling blocks, God calls stepping stones.\nWhat we call weakness, God calls strength!\nWhat we call losing the battle, God calls a victory for His kingdom!\nWhat we call impossibilities, He calls possibilities.\nWhat we call sinners, He calls saints!\nThe apostle James reminds us the following: “Consider it a SHEER GIFT, friends, when TESTS and CHALLENGES come at you from all sides. You know that under pressure, your faith-life is forced into the open and shows its true colors. So don’t try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way” (James 1:2–4 The Message). Suffering and pain have a way to refine you, make you fit for the Kingdom of God, compassionate towards others, and draw you closer to the heart of God!\nGod is not for strong people! It takes surrendering to give up self, and walk by faith. It takes exactly the opposite of what the culture teaches us to walk with God. Followers of God join a counter-culture movement when they surrender to God. It takes vulnerability to learn to trust. It is easy to grow up, it is hard to “ungrow” and become “like a child” again, once habits, tendencies and behaviors have been established for years! (Matthew 18:3)\nHave you ever felt like God is too demanding? Is total surrender too difficult? Throughout eternity, you will realize it was worth it to live for God on this earth! No sacrifice is too big! No effort to bring people to the Kingdom of God, will go unrewarded. God is watching you and me now.\nHere is the paradox. While God is not for those who are humanly strong, it takes spiritual fortitude and strength of character, to surrender to God! It is a jump into the unknown!\nJesus replied, “And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for my sake, will receive a HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH IN RETURN and will inherit eternal life. But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then” Matthew 19: 29-30. Can you think of any investment that will give you a greater return? This is not a literal expression. It simply means that what God will give us in the future will hundred times more valuable than what we give up for Him now!\nLong term, I believe you will live with peace, and a hope that nothing else, and no one else, will ever be able to give you. Every trial you face, will make you better, when you are following God. God is in charge of your life, and He takes all situations and transform them for your own good. When you follow God, everything happens for a purpose. Romans 8:28.\nEMBRACE SUFFERING, Jesus said!\nAt the end you will receive your BEST LIFE EVER!\nAn eternal reward!\nA fulfilled purpose for the honor of God!\nAnd then the best is yet to come.\nThe greatest reason why I am not able to bless more people, it\u0026rsquo;s because they choose to do things their way, instead of my way. That\u0026rsquo;s why the reading of the Bible, prayer, meditations, and time with me matters. I long to share with you thoughts that match the purpose for which I created you. I long to share with you the foundational principles of LIFE.\nThere is a way that seems right to you, you follow it, you become obsess with it\u0026hellip; You sweat your way into it. But in the end, I know it will lead you into losing your life. Trust me, if I block the way.\nI long to bless you, Friend! I long to bestow blessings in your life far beyond what you have ever imagined!\nCome to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and lightly.\nI love you, Friend! - God\n(See The Message: 2 Chronicles 16:9; Isaiah 55: 8,9; Proverbs 14:12; Matthew 11: 28-30)\nI believe that followers of God receive immediate positive results when they choose to follow God. Their life style is conducive to health and well being.\nLong term, I believe you will live with peace, and a hope that nothing else, and no one else, will ever be able to give you. Every trial you face, will make you better, when you are following God. God is in charge of your life, and He takes all situations and transform them for your own good. When you follow God, everything happens for a purpose. Romans 8:28.\nThen you have the grand finale. Because when you die believing in God, it\u0026rsquo;s but a split before you wake up and se Jesus come in the clouds of heaven. Is anything better than that, Friend? To rest in the assurance that we go to sleep on this earth, under God\u0026rsquo;s care.\nThen we all go to heaven. We will have rewards waiting for us there. Then after thousand years, heaven will come to Earth, and we will forever and ever live eternally on this earth renewed. Revelation 20. We will have the rule and reign of Christ on the Earth in the new kingdom, and we will be a part of that. Earth will become the capital of the universe. No one in the entire universe will be closer to God than humans. Jesus, is one of us, and we will be like Him in body. We will be ruling and reigning with Jesus then. And that statement of Jesus in response to Peter\u0026rsquo;s question will be fulfilled then. Oh, Peter\u0026hellip; Yes\u0026hellip; But then, what about you and me, Friend? Don\u0026rsquo;t you feel like Peter at times?\nSo whatever you have given up—or whatever you are giving up—will be more than made up to you, friend!\nThroughout eternity, you will realize it was worth it to live for God on this earth! No sacrifice is too big! No effort to bring people to the Kingdom of God, will go unrewarded. God is watching you and me now.\nGod surprises us with HIS EXTRAVAGANT LOVE when we are working up a deal with Him! His deal is so much better!! If His extravagant love does not melt your heart into surrendering your pride, your perfectionism, your habits, your arrogance, your independent attitude, NOTHING ELSE WILL MATTER!\nGod has the best deal for you, friend! Only, when you SURRENDER to the extravagant love of God as a bond servant, you become truly free! That\u0026rsquo;s the paradox of authentic Christianity, and the dark side of religion.\n"}).add({id:17,href:"/docs/book/what-is-love/",title:"What is Love?",description:"We follow those two greatest commandments—loving God and loving our neighbors—by imitating Jesus himself, and then teaching others to do the same.

That is essentially what it means to be a disciple, or to be a Christian; it is to be someone who imitates Christ, or to be someone who imitates someone who imitates Christ (1 Corinthians 11:1).\nThe English language has a poor comprehension of the word ‘love’, because it has many different meanings. In Greek, there are actually six different words that all translate to the word “love” in English, such as agape versus phileo. The “love” expected of us is elaborated by the servant Paul.\n Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. (1 Corinthians 13:4-8)\n If one will do as Christ commanded, one will discover eternal life or love and peace, of joy unimaginable, a place where the knowledge of good and evil is replaced with divine love. A place where all of your ego \u0026ldquo;issues\u0026rdquo; vanish, a place that is very real. We call it heaven. It is real, it is a place, and it is hidden, a secret, unknowable unless it is revealed by the Creator. Search it out for yourself through faith and obedience to Christ. Find Christ and you have discovered the country! Don’t just believe in it, or have faith it exists, Jesus commanded us to find it, for it is in Him, and Him alone. The knowledge of good and evil does not work well, and the story of humanity proves it does not work at all.\nGreatest Love Of All Your browser does not support the audio element.   There is no fear in love [dread does not exist]. But perfect (complete, full-grown) love drives out fear, because fear involves [the expectation of divine] punishment, so the one who is afraid [of God’s judgment] is not perfected in love [has not grown into a sufficient understanding of God’s love] (1 John 4:18, Amp)\nSo while the disciples were trained to create disciples, and to teach, and to cast out demons, and to heal, the most important thing is that they were instructed to love, and to do all these things in that love.\nBy having regular, loving fellowship with the other disciples. We human beings here on Earth are the physical body of Jesus in his stead while He remains in Heaven, until he returns to rule and reign here on Earth. As the body of Christ, we are many body parts (1 Corinthians 12:12-31), and we must take our place in loving harmony with the other body parts.\nBy making more disciples. That is what Jesus did during his entire time of ministry on Earth. That is how Christianity—the fully realized structured kingdom of Jesus—came to be.\n\u0026ldquo;If I speak with human eloquence and angelic ecstasy, BUT I DON\u0026rsquo;T LOVE, I\u0026rsquo;M NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF A RUSTY GATE. If I speak God\u0026rsquo;s Word with power, revealing all his mysteries and making everything plain as day, and if I have faith that says to a mountain, \u0026ldquo;Jump,\u0026rdquo; and it jumps, BUT I DON\u0026rsquo;T LOVE, I\u0026rsquo;M NOTHING. If I give everything I own to the poor and even go to the stake to be burned as a martyr, BUT I DON\u0026rsquo;T LOVE, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten nowhere. So, no matter what I say, what I believe, and what I do, I\u0026rsquo;M BANKRUPT WITHOUT LOVE.\nHumans idolize and worship what they admire\u0026hellip; That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the subject of idolatry is LOVING! In fact, more often than not, the intoxicating mix of a need to be adored, and the admiration of people, reveal the absence of LOVE, thus the creaking of a rusty gate\u0026hellip; Shhh\u0026hellip; Can you hear it, Friend?\nLove is COMPASSION IN ACTION! Only a relationship with God can teach you how to be COMPASSIONATE IN ACTION.\nWhat force is predominant in my life? LOVE or FEAR? Ask yourself that question often. Love unites, bonds, brings together, feels empathy, creates community. Fear separates, pulls away, condemns, blames, creates differences, runs away, avoids comparisons, protects self from suffering, and unwelcome inconvenience. The habit of compassion, is the actual practice of relieving people of their suffering. Once you can empathize with another person, and understand his humanity and suffering, the next step is to want that person to be free from suffering. This is the heart of compassion — actually the definition of it.\nI believe compassion to be a spiritual quality second to none. Compassion is a derivative of the deepest expression of love there is. Compassion is one of the few things we can practice that will bring immediate and long-term joy, fulfillment and peace. The kind that sticks!\nGod is the very model of love and compassion. This is the way the author of Exodus described the encounter between God and Moses in Mount Sinai:\n \u0026ldquo;Then he passed in front of Moses, calling out, “The Lord, the Lord, a COMPASSIONATE and MERCIFUL GOD, patient, always faithful and ready to forgive. He continues to show his love to thousands of generations, forgiving wrongdoing, disobedience, and sin.\u0026rdquo; Exodus 34:6-7 (God\u0026rsquo;s Word Translation)\n  \u0026ldquo;Compassion is an emotion that is a sense of SHARED SUFFERING, most often combined with a desire to alleviate or REDUCE THE SUFFERING OF ANOTHER; to show special kindness to those who suffer. Compassion essentially arises through empathy, and is often characterized through ACTIONS, wherein a person acting with compassion will seek to aid those they feel compassionate for.\u0026rdquo;\n Love in the eyes of God when on this earth was the greatest commandment . . . His prime directive—Let God love you, live loved, love God, love self, love neighbor, love stranger, alien, immigrants, LGTBQ, without racial or gender discrimination, the homeless, outsiders, outcast, and enemies, as he himself modeled it.\nThe new commandment of love (John 13:35) meant that neither beliefs nor words, nor dogmas, neither taboos, systems, structures, organized religion, nor the labels that enshrined them mattered most.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new wine\u0026rdquo; (love and compassion) demands \u0026ldquo;new containers\u0026rdquo; (new system, new movement, a fresh relational theology, for ALL people). ONE GOD for ALL people.\nLove decenters everything else; love shifts all religious obsessions into a minimalist basic ethos of community such as the early Apostolic church.\nLove relativizes everything else; love takes priority over everything else—literally everything.\nIn fact love becomes more important than \u0026ldquo;right and wrong\u0026rdquo; according to religious or cultural constructs.\nAt the end of time, at the Second Coming of God, the Biblical narrative says there will only be two groups of people.\nThose who understood \u0026ldquo;LOVE IS ENOUGH\u0026rdquo; and those who didn\u0026rsquo;t (Matthew 25:31-46)\nGod\u0026rsquo;s minimalist relational theology will be made clear. The core of God ethos as a qualification for eternal life is not doctrines or belief systems but LOVE and COMPASSION.\nLove is the only creative, constructive, and forward-leaning message of God for people from all religions and all walks of life.\nI believe that the greatest challenges followers of God will face is how to remain loving and compassionate in the midst of a world where most people will lose their ability to love and be loved. (Matthew 24:12)\n To understand the love of God. The only thing that makes you compassionate towards sinners and people who you feel deserve punishment and discipline for what they have done is the LOVE OF GOD.\n \u0026ldquo;When we trust in him, we\u0026rsquo;re free to say whatever needs to be said, bold to go wherever we need to go\u0026hellip;My response is to get down on my knees before the Father, this magnificent Father who parcels out all heaven and earth. I ask him to strengthen you by his Spirit—not a brute strength but a GLORIOUS INNER STRENGTH—that Christ will live in you as you open the door and invite him in. And I ask him that with both feet planted firmly on love, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to take in with all followers of Jesus the extravagant dimensions of Christ\u0026rsquo;s love. Reach out and experience the breadth! Test its length! Plumb the depths! Rise to the heights! Live full lives, full in the fullness of God. God can do anything, you know—far more than you could ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams! He does it not by pushing us around but by working within us, his Spirit deeply and gently within us. (Ephesians 3: 12-21)\nThere will be no peace in your heart until you experience the love and the grace of God. When someone has hurt you badly, betrayed you to the bone, the human side of you only considers consequences, punishment and pain. When you have been touched by the passionate love of God, you will long to see people turning to God.\nTo be a follower of God is costly! To stand against the popular trends is costly! It was costly to Jesus. It was costly to the apostles. It will be costly for anyone who chooses a radical discipleship in behalf of God\u0026rsquo;s cause in the world.\nC. S. Lewis wrote, \u0026ldquo;To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you love God, you also will suffer as a result, because people will attack you for your love for Him and your radical position on issues. That is what happened with the church of Smyrna in the book of Revelation. Here is what Jesus\u0026rsquo; had to say to this suffering church:\nI know about your suffering and your poverty—but you are rich! I know the blasphemy of those opposing you. They say they are Jews, but they are not, because their synagogue belongs to Satan. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil will throw some of you into prison to test you. You will suffer for ten days. But if you remain faithful even when facing death, I will give you the crown of life. Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. Whoever is victorious will not be harmed by the second death. (Revelation 2:9–11)\nThis is the shortest of the seven messages Jesus gave to these churches, and it is interesting to note there are no critical words. Jesus simply commended and encouraged this church. And instead of destroying the church, persecution actually strengthened it. The same will happen in our time, Friend!\nIt is easy to belong to the masses of political, cultural and religious\u0026quot;flip-flop.\u0026rdquo; It is costly to stand for the radical discipleship of Jesus.\nHere is the promise to those who stand firm in times when it seems like everyone is surrendering to popular pressure.\n\u0026ldquo;Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand.\u0026rdquo; Psalm 37:24\n"}).add({id:18,href:"/docs/book/freedom-in-christ/",title:"Freedom in Christ",description:"God Transforms Lives: The Best is Yet to Come! # Isaiah 61 gives us a powerful insight into God\u0026rsquo;s transforming power.\nThe promises of this chapter were made to the Jews returned out of captivity, which extend to all those who, through grace, are delivered out of spiritual doom!

For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign LORD will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.\nTotal transformation is what God does in your life when you surrender to Him. He changes your motives. He changes your drive. He changes your values. He makes you compassionate. He touches you so you can talk to other about Him. He makes you a witness of His glory and power so can reach other for the Kingdom of God.\nWhen Jesus Christ truly comes into our lives, He takes up residence. And He doesn\u0026rsquo;t just do a basic housecleaning; He does a thorough one. There is real, total, deep transformation. But when a house has only been swept, that is, when someone has made only moral changes, he or she is still vulnerable to the enemy. Did you know, you could be good without God, you can live a moral, ethically right life, and still end up in hell?\nIf the power and the presence of God has not been manifested in your life, and continues to be manifested every day, you are not walking with God.\nThis is why we must recognize the futility of simply turning over a new leaf or making a few new resolutions. We must realize the problem is deeper than our moral sins. We must get to the heart of the matter and have Jesus Christ take residence in our lives and change us from the inside out.\nFor the person who has made a mess of his or her life—a pile of ashes, God says, \u0026ldquo;I will bring beauty.\u0026rdquo; For those who mourn because of the wrongs they have done and the sins they have committed, God says, \u0026ldquo;I will bring joy out of it.\u0026rdquo; For those who have been rejected, hurt by others, God says, \u0026ldquo;I will bring healing into your life, festive praise, instead of despair.\u0026rdquo;\nOnly God can do that; only He can take a tangled mess of a life, turn it around, and transform it in such a way that you would not even know that individual used to be a whole different person. God is not into the recycling business, he is into the total transformation of broken lives.\nPaul wrote in 2 Corinthians 5:17-20 (The Message) the following: \u0026ldquo;Now we look inside, and what we see is that anyone united with [Christ] gets a FRESH START, is CREATED NEW. The OLD LIFE IS GONE; A NEW LIFE BURGEONS! Look at it! All this comes from the God who settled the relationship between us and him, and then called us to settle our relationships with each other. God put the world square with himself through [Christ], giving the world a fresh start by offering forgiveness of sins. GOD HAS GIVEN IS THE TASK OF TELLING EVERYONE WHAT HE IS DOING. We\u0026rsquo;re Christ\u0026rsquo;s representatives. God uses us to persuade men and women to drop their differences and enter into God\u0026rsquo;s work of making things right between them. We\u0026rsquo;re speaking for Christ himself now: BECOME FRIENDS WITH GOD; HE\u0026rsquo;S ALREADY A FRIEND WITH YOU.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat a magnificent description of God\u0026rsquo;s passion for you and me, Friend! God is your friend! God is longing to bless you, give you peace and rest!\nIf you come to Christ today and say, \u0026ldquo;Jesus, here I am.

God can take your mistakes and your sins, and the hurts other people have inflicted on you, turn them around, and even use them for His glory. When you commit your life to Christ, putting the broken, stained, twisted pieces into His hand, He will transform it into an incredible piece of Divine art!\nJesus Wants You to be Free # Until you believe that God does everything RIGHT you won’t find peace in your heart! Every single event of your life, good or bad, is being managed by God if you are His follower. (Romans 8:28-The Message)\nWhen you surrender to God, He takes your past, your entire life, and transforms it into something gorgeous. GOD ALWAYS DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Your salvation requires you to turn back to me and stop your silly efforts to save yourselves. Your strength will come from settling down in complete dependence on me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Isaiah 30:15-18 Message)\nGalatians 5, (and the entire book of Galatians for that matter) is all about the freedom we can experience when we accept God, Jesus, His grace, and His power in our lives. It doesn’t mean by any stretch of the imagination, we have arrived to a level of static perfection! It simply means that when God declares you FREE, you are free, indeed! FREE forever! You’ve got to believe God’s Word by faith. Trust that He means what He says! YOU ARE FREE WHEN YOU ACCEPT HIM IN YOUR LIFE. No one, nothing, will ever take that status away from you, except your own choice to live a miserable life of rejection of God, to the moment you breathe your last breath! The person who accepts [a rule keeping system] trades all the advantages of the free life in Christ for the obligations of the slave life of the law. When you attempt to live by your own religious plans and projects, you are cut off from Christ, YOU FALL OUT OF GRACE. Meanwhile we expectantly wait for a satisfying relationship with the Spirit. For in Christ, neither our MOST CONSCIENTIOUS RELIGION nor DISREGARD OF RELIGION amounts to ANYTHING. What matters is something far more interior: FAITH EXPRESSED IN LOVE. It is absolutely clear that GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO A FREE LIFE. Just make sure that you don’t use this freedom as an excuse to do whatever you want to do and destroy your freedom. Rather, use your freedom to serve one another in love; that’s how freedom grows. For EVERYTHING we know about God’s Word IS SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE SENTENCE: LOVE OTHERS AS YOU LOVE YOURSELF. That’s an act of true freedom. If you bite and ravage each other, watch out—in no time at all you will be annihilating each other, and where will your precious freedom be then? The magnificent FREEDOM of God granted to you by GRACE is grown, nurtured and affirmed by LOVE. Live freely, animated and motivated by God’s Spirit. Then you won’t feed the compulsions of selfishness. For there is a root of sinful self-interest in us that is at odds with a free spirit, just as the free spirit is incompatible with selfishness. These two ways of life are antithetical, so that you cannot live at times one way and at times another way according to how you feel on any given day. Why don’t you choose to be led by the Spirit and so escape the erratic compulsions of a law-dominated existence?\nHave you ever experienced the freedom of God? Pray like this:\n “God, I accept your freedom in the name of Jesus! I am free indeed, because you promised me that I could be free for the rest of my life. Teach me through your Spirit the implications of being a free person. Teach me how to embrace my humanity without shame… Teach me to accept the broken self in me the same you accept me! Give me eyes to see myself, like You see me, God! Grant me peace, now… Teach me how to forgive myself, when I make mistakes… I believe you took my SIN away forever when Jesus died on the cross of Calvary… Give me the strength to let go, and live as a FREE citizen of your Kingdom of Grace and Love. Remind me to look at people, like you see them! In the name of Jesus, AMEN”\n Repentance # \u0026ldquo;Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, NOT REALIZING THAT GOD\u0026rsquo;S KINDNESS IS INTENDED TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE?\u0026rdquo;\nRepentance (from the Greek \u0026ldquo;metanoia\u0026rdquo;) means CHANGE as an afterthought. In psychological terms \u0026ldquo;metanoia\u0026rdquo; or this kind of change is the process of experiencing a \u0026ldquo;break down\u0026rdquo; and subsequent, positive psychological re-building or \u0026ldquo;healing\u0026rdquo;\nSuch \u0026ldquo;breakdown\u0026rdquo; preceding change can be caused by human means as I mentioned above, OR by God\u0026rsquo;s KINDNESS.\nThink of it\u0026hellip;\nGod is deeply invested in the CHANGE of people by means of LOVING, showing mercy, grace and KINDNESS. Hell and suffering are not God\u0026rsquo;s creation. They are the result of sin and the rejection of God\u0026rsquo;s love and kindness. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to pay for the penalty of your sin/s any longer. God did it for you in the person of Jesus Christ. God does not condemn you, HE LOVES YOU! (John 3: 16-18) So you either accept His love or reject it. It is as simple as that, friend! I have said it many times: \u0026ldquo;If LOVE does not change the heart of a person, all other sources may change the behavior but not the HEART! I have watched people who every one though they had change for 30 years, to watch them destroy themselves in one moment, because their heart was never been touched by deep and abiding love. They simply contained their behavior for 30 years because of fear, religion, or self-discipline. In one moment of weakness it was all gone! I also know people who have grown in very unloving, and broken down situations, victims of child abuse, a world of drugs and crime\u0026hellip; somehow, they caught a glimpse of the LOVE OF GOD and they actually surrendered to such love! These people do not reflect the symptoms of others that grew up under similar circumstances. Why is that?\nYou see, human behavior is mostly predictable. A reward system creates predictable behavior. Fear creates predictable behavior. The only think that changes the human heart from the inside out, in spite of, and beyond, circumstances, reward and fear, is LOVE.\nI know how love and kindness makes me want to please another human being. Love melts my heart! Love makes me want to be better. Love makes me want to give my best! Love drives me to do what nothing else will do.\nAt the end of the day, what drives you to do what you do,friend? What motivates you to change? Love or Fear? Love or the need to fit?\nLOVE is God\u0026rsquo;s strategy to get people like you and me to change! I pray that you may catch a glimpse of such incredible LOVE and choose to follow God in the purpose He has for your life on this earth!\n"}).add({id:19,href:"/docs/book/rest-not-religion/",title:"Rest Not Religion",description:"Rest Not Religion # Jesus Christ did not say anything about religion in the Bible!

His focus was on the kingdom of God and your relationship with Him as His Bride!\nWhat is the Church then? A Church is simply you, me, and others like us, who believe that Jesus is the son of God. To be a Christian is to be “of Christ “or to be a follower of Jesus. The word Christian is all inclusive. It needs no other word added to it for explanation or definition. Men have created denominations (churches) in order to separate and regulate those who profess to believe alike.\nIn reality, all faith is individual. No person believes exactly like another person. We all have a unifying point of faith and brotherhood: the Lord Jesus. He calls us to love and respect each other, but never to believe exactly alike. A person who has accepted Jesus as his or her personal Savior has done so just like all other Christians throughout history. Those who willingly devote their lives to Him find that they are doing more than just following His directions; they find themselves developing a loving relationship with Him. They call upon Him as a friend in times of need and times of joy. He is their constant companion. Now, if you have felt that God has abandoned you and that probably everyone else is enjoying this relationship but not you – don’t despair. God has promised never to leave you.\nThe real church is about Jesus Christ, loosing yourself not finding self; and also practical love for others. It’s simple - live in God’s love and share it with others. You can find God’s love in the secret place (the prayer closet).\nEphesians 2:7-10 (The Message) is one of the most liberating messages of the Bible. It dismantles RELIGION totally! I call it the “RELIGION DEMOLITION” message directly from the heart of God. “Now God has [YOU] where he wants [YOU], with all the time in this world and the next [God has all the time in the world. There is NO anxiety! God’s journey begins with REST! No hurry] to shower grace and kindness upon [YOU] in Christ Jesus.\u0026quot;\nAll we do is trust him enough to LET HIM DO IT.\nIt’s God’s gift from start to finish! We don’t play the major role. If we did, we’d probably go around bragging that we’d done the whole thing!\nNo, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving. He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing.”\nJesus is not a casual friend. He is not a once a week date kind of deal. He invites you to walk with Him, He doesn’t ask you where you are going so He can join you for a walk… He doesn’t tell you, “When you come back from work join me for a walk.” His invitation takes priority over everything you do. Think about it… Wouldn’t life be easier if we would get up every morning to walk with Jesus? Instead of going to work, you walk with Jesus. Instead of going grocery shopping, you walk with Jesus. Now follow me on this thought because here is the most fun part of walking with Jesus. He does not only invite you to walk with Him, but He leads the way into all those places where you think “you have to go.” Did you know that?\nIn another of His strategies for life He simply says, “Follow Me.” (Matthew 8:22) This is radical! 23 times Jesus said “Follow me.”\nHave you ever considered the implications of following Jesus? When you are on the freeway and a car behind you bumps you, Jesus says, “Follow me!” What does that mean? It means Jesus was there before the incident happened! If you are truly following Jesus, every situation you walk into, every room you go to, every person you meet, Jesus is already there! Why would He otherwise say, “Follow me!” When you face an angry spouse, Jesus says, “Follow me.” That means He is already there dealing with the situation. When a loved ones dies, Jesus says, “Follow me”… In other words, it is safe for you to walk into this painful moment because I am here already… When you face a tough moment with your teenager, Jesus says, “Follow me.” In other words… I am here already! Walk with me is not just a casual spiritual experience with Jesus. It means CONFIDENCE because He is already walking ahead of us!]\nStop Worrying # Fear will paralyze you and keep you from the victory that God has planned for you. Fear is a spirit and the spirit of fear is not from God.\nPeace is a show of confidence. Peace is the outward manifestation of an internal confidence and confidence is the manifestation of pure faith. Mature faith running at full power will destroy all of the plans and purposes of the enemy while delivering joy to the warrior of God. You can actually be swinging the sword of truth in what looks like the battle of your life with a smile on your face, peace in your heart, and victory on your lips.**\nBecause you know the Word and because the Word says, \u0026ldquo;Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world,\u0026rdquo; you do not fear. Because you know God is on your side and because you believe Him, you stand in faith knowing that no weapon formed against you can ever prosper. You are victorious and you know it, and because you know it, you have peace.\nQuit begging God to give you peace. He already has. Romans 5:1 says that as believers \u0026ldquo;having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u0026rdquo; Jesus is the King of peace and in Ephesians we are told that He Himself is our peace. (Ephesians 2:14) Not only that, but the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, God Himself lives inside of you. You are a three-part being. You are spirit, soul, and body. When you became a believer, the very Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, moved inside of your spirit. As a Christian, you are literally Spirit-possessed.\nYour spirit is you, my spirit is me, and the Spirit of God is God. Because you are indwelt with the Spirit of God, you have the peace of God inside of you and regardless of what is on the outside, you have the fruit of the Spirit on the inside. As a Christian, He who is in you (The Holy Spirit) is greater than what is outside of you.\nThe peace of God should be flowing out of you into the world instead of the stress and pressures of the world getting into you. You have at your disposal the greatest power in the universe. Nothing can overpower the love of God and according to 1 John 4:7-8, God is love. Perfect love casts out fear.\nWorry and stress are byproducts of fear. Rest and peace are byproducts of faith. To eradicate the fear, all we must do is walk in perfect love and be led by the Spirit. Then the peace of God will flow from us and minister to a world that is living in darkness.\nJesus said you are the light of the world. You have a responsibility to let the light shine from you into the darkness. Your testimony of peace will encourage and minister to others and you will discover through walking in the peace and rest of God that you will bring glory to God. \u0026ldquo;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 5:16)\nWalking in faith will make you a warrior. Walking in fear will make you a worrier. Warriors overcome the enemy and enjoy peace and rest even during times of battle. Worriers live in a world of tension and stress, continually in fear at what might happen. What world are you living in?\nGet Close to God # The most important reason to get close to God is the fact that you were created BY God and FOR God. There is a hole in your heart that nothing else can fill. You were created to be a star in the skies of God’s universe! You were created to shine, not walk in this world holding a flash light! You were created to find greatness, not limits!\nDo you know how good it feels to know, deep down in your heart, that you have been declared perfect by the GRACE of God since the time of eternity? You can not produce the kind of “goodness” that God wants to see in you, friend! He longs to do it, in you, His way!\nYou were created to dream BIG! You were created for MEANING, not just morals. You were born for a PURPOSE, not just for a passing life on this earth! You were created to live in ETERNITY! Nothing, nothing, will fill the hole of your soul, except the immensity of God\u0026rsquo;s presence! Nothing else suffices!\nKing David in one of his psalms says,\nYou're all I want in heaven! You're all I want on earth! When my skin sags and my bones get brittle, God is rock-firm and faithful. Look! Those who left you are falling apart! But I'm in the very presence of God— oh, how refreshing it is! I've made Lord God my home. God, I'm telling the world what you do!  – Psalm 73:25-28-The Message\nWhen you are close to God, you get to know what LIFE is! God is your protection, your source of renewal, and energy.\nSome people think being close to God is just for RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. Nothing could be farther from the truth! In fact, the opposite is the truth! God longs to befriend simple people! Regardless of your career, your social position in life, the baggage you carry from your past, you can get close to God. Getting close to God does not depend on some special gifting from God; getting close to God depends on your choice. God longs to be close to you! This is how easy it is to get close to God\u0026hellip;\n James 4:8, The Message, says, \u0026ldquo;Say a quiet yes to God and he\u0026rsquo;ll be there in no time.\u0026rdquo; Did you catch that? This verse is both a command and a promise.\n God is your fortress in difficult times. God will never let you down. Spend time with Him. Surrender every challenge you face to Him. One, by one\u0026hellip; In the morning\u0026hellip; Ask God to guide you TODAY\u0026hellip; Just today\u0026hellip; God is your best insurance policy in the world! As we wait for the Second Coming of Jesus, and our worlds spirals down, there is HOPE! God is YOUR hope!\nWould you consider getting close to God today, Friend? There is no shame with God! There is no guilt with Him! He never accuses! He only LOVES. God infuses the pain and the suffering of this life with a sense of meaning! He turns scars into stars for His glory!\n"}).add({id:20,href:"/docs/book/why-evil/",title:"Why Evil?",description:"God commands two thirds of all the cosmic angelic forces, while the devil only commands one third.

The devil\u0026rsquo;s counter-life-LOVE movement (Fear-SIN) is already defeated and \u0026ldquo;contained.\u0026rdquo;\nGod\u0026rsquo;s plan to deal with this \u0026ldquo;temper-tantrum\u0026rdquo; was put into effect when God created Adam and Eve, during the Great Controversy for the 4.000 years prior to the coming of Jesus, and it was sealed on the cross of Calvary (\u0026ldquo;It is finished\u0026rdquo;- ) as a cosmic testimony to the universe, that the devil was actually defeated forever! And after Jesus\u0026rsquo; resurrection and ascension to heaven, the great controversy goes on, on a crescendo all the way to the Second Coming of Jesus, followed by the thousands years \u0026ldquo;vacation\u0026rdquo; we will take in Heaven, and the triumphal return to a renewed planet earth, capital of the Universe, and the total and absolute vanishing of demonic powers forever and ever!\n The greatest, most iconic image of the Great Controversy is the fact that we know the end before it happens. Yeah, there is some intrigue and anxiety going on in the minds of some, on how all this \u0026ldquo;time of the end prophecies\u0026rdquo; will play out, but the details are not important, and they are not for us to know. What is important to know is the signs of the times, and the end is secured since the times of eternity. Ephesians 1\n God is not the cause of anything that is bad. It would totally contradict the nature of His character. But God manages evil. And He is stronger and more powerful that the one who caused evil to happen in this world.\n“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “BUT THIS HAPPENED SO THAT THE WORKS OF GOD MIGHT BE DISPLAYED IN HIM.\u0026quot; (John 9:2-3)\nNothing happens in this world outside of God\u0026rsquo;s control and His perfect management. God is bigger and greater than the evil forces that cause disasters, disease and chaos on this planet. God has never lost control of anything! Ever! Nothing is an accident in God\u0026rsquo;s universe! The illusion that if you plan your perfect life you will be able to enjoy it, is a fallacy\u0026hellip;. It is an illusion! Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. I have known people who have been the best managers of money you have ever met. They calculated everything. They were careful with their investments. They saved money. They made phenomenal moves at the right time and accumulated wealth! They put money aside for rainy days. They did all the right things. And then suddenly they got hit by cancer and they didn\u0026rsquo;t get to enjoy any of it. True story! Others suffered empty, loveless lives in spite of their \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; lives. They feel empty, lonely and suffer of existential meaninglessness. So, money became empty! God may be allowing you to face a painful experience in your life now, for a PURPOSE! You may be the equivalent of the \u0026ldquo;blind\u0026rdquo; man with a different condition. And while people around you are questioning if you did something wrong to deserve such curse, or you are questioning yourself, or people are telling you that if you would have done things differently you would not be where you are at\u0026hellip; While all the questioning is going on\u0026hellip; God is saying\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THIS TRIAL, THIS DARK SPOT\u0026hellip; I WANT TO DISPLAY MY GREATNESS IN YOUR LIFE.\u0026rdquo; Imagine that!\nThere is nothing more humbling than to realize that your perfectly organized life does not make you happy. You can laugh a lot\u0026hellip;. Entertain yourself a lot\u0026hellip; Please yourself a lot\u0026hellip; God created you with a hole in your heart for His PURPOSE. Nothing else will fill it out! Curse only turns into blessing when God takes over, like in the case of the blind man in Jesus\u0026rsquo; miracle Blessings turn into curse when you fail to bless the world by giving away what blesses you! What distinguishes you as a follower of God from those who are not, is your blessed life turned upside down to reach people for the kingdom of God. Hell will be intensely populated by good people, religious people, who lived the good life now to please themselves, and somehow forgot to find God\u0026rsquo;s purpose for their lives.\n\u0026ldquo;Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\u0026rdquo; Romans 12: 21\nMost of us experience evil on a smaller, more personal scale. But for all EVIL attacks, small and huge, the apostle Paul outlined the proper response in Romans 12: 14-21-The Message.\nHe said we are:\n1) to ABHOR evil (Rom. 12:9),\n2) not to REPAY it with more EVIL (v.17),\n3) and not to be overcome by it (v.21).\nThe true victim of EVIL is goodness\u0026hellip; Think about it! The goodness that God designed as part of creation for everyone to enjoy (Gen. 1:4-31) is attacked, shaken up, and terrorized by EVIL.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why it is so surprising that Paul concludes his magnificent expose on GOOD and EVIL by saying that at the end of it all, EVIL becomes a casualty at the hand of its CONQUEROR, which is GOODNESS! (Rom. 12:21). Don\u0026rsquo;t miss this principle when dealing with your personal anger on any matter!\nEvil gets all the headlines, but GOD\u0026rsquo;S GOODNESS IS STRONGER, and He wants you to use it on His behalf to overcome His and YOUR enemy. This principle gets me going! Why is it so hard to practice it? Why do people keep insisting on destroying those who hurt them? Why do people are so driven to seek vengeance and revenge? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, the Bible says!!!\nIf you are facing the effects of someone’s EVIL actions I will share with you what healed me when I faced it in my own life. These Scriptures were incredibly helpful: Prov. 20:22; Matt. 5:38-48; 1 Thess. 5:15; 1 Peter 3:8-17. I recommend you read them in The Message to capture the full impact of God\u0026rsquo;s word and its meaning.\nDo not just be quick to point out EVIL. Anyone can do that! Find a strategy to deal with it! Use God\u0026rsquo;s strategy!\nIt takes no effort to seek vengeance against a spouse in a marriage. It takes no effort to seek to destroy someone\u0026rsquo;s reputation. It takes no effort to pay EVIL with EVIL. All you need is enough toxicity and EVIL in yourself, to drive you to destroy those who did EVIL to you! You can seek revenge in words, statements, accusations, gossip, innuendos, actions and constant obsession with the negativity that hurts you!\nTo abhor EVIL, not to repay EVIL with more EVIL, and not to be overcome by EVIL requires God\u0026rsquo;s supernatural power.\nThen, to overcome EVIL with GOOD, which is the higher level of spiritual consciousness, is impossible for humans to do, unless their hearts and brains are transformed by the cleansing grace of God.\nDarkness is not REAL. It\u0026rsquo;s just the absence of LIGHT. Light\novercomes darkness very quickly once you bring a light in\u0026hellip; GONE!!!\nEVIL is defeated already. Did you know that? Why use a DEFEATED strategy? Why? Every person who pays EVIL with EVIL, in words or actions, is ignorant of God\u0026rsquo;s character. You can talk about saving lost people or religious truth, until you are blue on the face, but in the end, it is inconsistent with the spirit of God, if your political views drive you to say and act EVIL for EVIL! Every act of vengeance executed by people, simply shows demonic forces in action. Every person who seeks revenge for a hurt suffered is simply giving in to forces that were defeated by God since the times of eternity! Taking things into your own hands is a denial of God\u0026rsquo;s existence! That\u0026rsquo;s why Paul said: overcome EVIL, which was defeated at last on the cross of Calvary when Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;It is finished,\u0026rdquo; with GOODNESS!\nThink about it\u0026hellip; The devil is walking around, tempting people, giving them the toys of life to distract them from God, destroying marriages\u0026hellip; encouraging people to pay EVIL with EVIL , which brings instant gratification and fulfillment\u0026hellip; well KNOWING that at the end of it all, HELL is his destination. The devil is a suicidal killer! It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if he attracts you with good stuff, such as prosperity, good behavior, angels of light, money, security, morals, religion, sex, success or drugs\u0026hellip; in the end his goal is the same for all\u0026hellip; DESTRUCTION AND HELL. He wants to die surrounded by an adoring dying crowd!\nLet the light of God, His love and His goodness be the marks of your response to EVIL inflicted against you!\n\u0026ldquo;How do I get rid of anger?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I forgive when I hurt so badly?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I move on?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I deal with the wounds of the past, the memories of the past?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; The list would be very long!\nTHERE IS ONLY ONE WAY, AND ONE WAY ALONE TO EXPERIENCE LASTING CHANGE, REAL FREEDOM\u0026hellip; NOTHING ELSE WORKS, LONG TERM, Friend The \u0026ldquo;only way\u0026rdquo; is described in Galatians 5:16-26 - [My comments]\nPaul says: \u0026ldquo;My counsel is this: Live freely, ANIMATED and MOTIVATED by God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit.\u0026rdquo;\n[The only way to experience true, lasting freedom, love, peace (SHALOM) and wholeness is THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD! I wish I could tell you there are some other strategies! The goal is to LIVE FREELY! Why? Because every single emotional, relational and spiritual issue you struggle with, makes you feel like a captive! You feel tortured! You feel like an emotional yo-yo\u0026ndash;up and down\u0026hellip; One day you feel good, the next day you feel dark\u0026hellip; One day you succeed, the next day you fail! What people need is LASTING FREEDOM from the emotional monsters such as ADDICTIONS, COMPULSIONS, INNER STRUGGLES, RELATIONAL CONFLICT, FEAR, ANXIETY, DARKNESS, and the tyranny of the SELF. What\u0026rsquo;s the only permanent resolution? To be set FREE forever, while being ANIMATED and MOTIVATED, by the Spirit of God!]\n[Then comes the RESULT! I love the assertiveness of Paul! If you accept the Spirit of God in your life\u0026hellip; THEN!]\nPaul says: \u0026ldquo;THEN YOU WON\u0026rsquo;T FEED THE COMPULSIONS OF SELFISHNESS.\u0026rdquo;\n[For the last 7 weeks we have been writing about the invisible war happening within ourselves, and outside of us in the world around. Paul describes this battle going on in the mind, the spirit and the heart of every single human being. What he asserts in this sentence is the fact that when you accept the Spirit of God in your life, YOU WON\u0026rsquo;T EVEN FEED\u0026hellip; THE COMPULSIONS OF SELFISHNESS! Notice the general label he uses to describe ALL your human challenges! Every single emotional and relational problem you face\u0026hellip; EVERYONE, falls under this label: THE COMPULSIONS OF SELFISHNESS! Your inability to forgive? Your inability to love? Your inability to stop an addiction? Your inability to focus on God? Your inability to get rid of obsessive materialism? Your inability to be generous? Your need for religion? Your inability to stop being judgmental, critical, racist or negative? Your lack of compassion? Your empty words not backed up by action? All of them are rooted in the same malady: \u0026ldquo;The compulsions of selfishness!\u0026rdquo;]\nPaul says: \u0026ldquo;For there is a root of sinful self-interest in us that is at odds with a free spirit, just as the free spirit is incompatible with selfishness. THESE TWO WAYS OF LIFE ARE ANTITHETICAL, so that you cannot live at times one way and at times another way according to how you feel on any given day. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you CHOOSE to be led by the Spirit and so escape the erratic compulsions of a law-dominated existence?\u0026rdquo;\n[Did you noticed? IT IS A CHOICE! CHOOSE THE SPIRIT OF GOD! The second thing I want you to notice in this statement by the Apostle Paul is: The erratic compulsions of a \u0026ldquo;law-dominated existence! This is fascinating! How could it be, that the erratic compulsions of a person are the result of a \u0026ldquo;law-dominated existence?\u0026rdquo; You see, Friend, NOTHING can control the storms of the soul permanently, except the spirit of God. When you are capable of controlling it by will power, self-control, morals, fear of punishment and behavioral modification (Paul calls it, \u0026ldquo;law-dominated existence) all you are doing is suppressing the compulsions of your human nature for a little while. They will eventually come up again! They are not permanently gone, they are not uprooted\u0026hellip; They are simply suppressed. That\u0026rsquo;s why \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; is such a weak solution to the human condition! Only a relationship with God and the presence of the Spirit of God can eradicate the compulsions of your nature!]\n[Here are the behavioral evidences of people who refuse to LIVE IN THE FREEDOM THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN CREATE in your inner life!]\nPaul says: \u0026ldquo;It is obvious what kind of life develops out of trying to get your own way all the time: repetitive, loveless, cheap sex; a stinking accumulation of mental and emotional garbage; frenzied and joyless grabs for happiness; trinket gods; magic-show religion; paranoid loneliness; cutthroat competition; all-consuming-yet-never-satisfied wants; a brutal temper; an impotence to love or be loved; divided homes and divided lives; small-minded and lopsided pursuits; the vicious habit of depersonalizing everyone into a rival; uncontrolled and uncontrollable addictions; ugly parodies of community. I could go on.\u0026rdquo;\n[Here are the behavioral and emotional manifestations of those who CHOOSE to walk by the Spirit of God. It is the Spirit of God that makes the difference in your life.]\nPaul says: \u0026ldquo;But what happens when we live God\u0026rsquo;s way? He brings gifts into our lives, much the same way that fruit appears in an orchard—things like affection for others, exuberance about life, serenity. We develop a willingness to stick with things, a sense of compassion in the heart, and a conviction that a basic holiness permeates things and people. We find ourselves involved in loyal commitments, not needing to force our way in life, able to marshal and direct our energies wisely.\u0026rdquo;\n[Here is what you must understand, accept and believe if you want to be free permanently! MORALITY, CULTURE, RELIGION, UP-BRINGING, SELF-WILL, POSITIVE THINKING, OPTIMISM won\u0026rsquo;t ever give you the freedom that the Spirit of God can give you!]\nPaul says: \u0026ldquo;LEGALISM [What is legalism? Legalism is making yourself obey laws, rules and regulations without spiritual energy\u0026hellip; Using self-will and will power to make yourself a good, moral and ethical person! Have you ever try to drive a car uphill on an EMPTY tank of gasoline? Have you ever tried to run a marathon, or bike up a hill without energy?

He started the whole mess in the universe by rebelling against God. He seduced Adam and Eve, introduced SIN in this world by lying, and from then on, SIN has been transmitted through our DNA. All you have to do to be a sinner is to be born. There is no hope for humans, except by the Grace of God! Every single ounce of pain and suffering in this world is from the devil. John 10:10 (NIV) Jesus said this, The thief [The intruder, your enemy the devil] comes ONLY to steal, and kill, and destroy.  Do you understand the words of Jesus,Friend? There is nothing good about the devil. It is all bad! His only purpose is to seduce you and destroy you! He knows He is sentenced to die forever, and is on a mission to take as many people down with him as possible! You cannot make a truce with the devil.

He will leave you alone if you are not following Jesus with your heart and reaching people for the Kingdom of God.

The stronger you get in God, the more the devil will attack you!\n Followers of God don\u0026rsquo;t need to be afraid of the devil. God is way bigger, stronger and powerful that the demonic forces. The devil and his demons are a defeated foe! They are destined to die. God has the power to protect from all demonic forces all the time.

The Bible calls the devil THE ACCUSER OF GOD’S PEOPLE.\nYOU NEED GOD to protect you from the evil attacks of your enemy.\nFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. (Ephesians 6:12)\nThis is the one thing the devil wants you to forget and ignore. Once you have stared the devil straight in the eye, on the face of SEDUCTION or SUFFERING you will never be the same again. The first step into spiritual victory is to understand the nature of the TRUE ENEMY, the real cause of the human conflict. The Bible is clear. It is not people we must look at as our REAL enemies. It is the DEVIL who drives people and self to do what they do!\nSeduction comes in the form of comfort, materialism, predictability, tangibility, idolatry (what you can touch, feel, smell, see and depend on-Political and social systems), false-empty pleasure, painless pleasure, the syndrome of the \u0026ldquo;greener grass\u0026rdquo; (delusion-illusions), competitiveness, efficiency, religion (creeds, beliefs, theological certainty, behavioral modification, morality), reward (Rich Young Ruler-Luke 18: 18-23), and a cause and result system; in other words, no room for the \u0026ldquo;Jobs,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The prodigal Sons\u0026rdquo; of the world!\nSuffering comes in the form of troubles, RELATIONAL BREAKDOWN, betrayal, vengeance, vicious attacks from \u0026ldquo;human enemies,\u0026rdquo; accusations, judgment, PERSECUTION for the sake of God (people making fun of you, your popularity suffering because you stand for God-Even religion \u0026ldquo;persecutes\u0026rdquo; authentic followers of God), financial, physical, emotional and spiritual suffering.\nIf you are faced with any of the issues mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21 (The Message) you are definitely dealing with demonic forces! \u0026ldquo;The Message\u0026rdquo; translates the original language with power! [My comments]\n\u0026ldquo;It is obvious what kind of life develops out of trying to get your own way all the time [SELFISHNESS-SELF ABSORBED]: repetitive, LOVELESS, cheap sex; a stinking accumulation of mental and emotional garbage; frenzied and joyless grabs for happiness; trinket gods; magic-show RELIGION; paranoid LONELINESS; cutthroat competition; all-consuming-yet-never-satisfied wants; a brutal temper; an IMPOTENCE TO LOVE OR BE LOVED; divided homes and divided lives; small-minded and lopsided pursuits; the vicious habit of depersonalizing everyone into a rival; uncontrolled and uncontrollable addictions; ugly parodies of community. I could go on.\u0026rdquo;\nPeople are imperfect. People make mistakes. That\u0026rsquo;s human. We need to learn to forgive and love. (Mark 11:25; Luke 6:37-The Message)\nDemonic driven behavior, however, must be acknowledged for what it is! If you don\u0026rsquo;t discern it as such, most likely your life will be intoxicated by negative feelings projected on to people or self as the cause of your misery!\nHere is my last point. To forgive people driven by demons is our duty as followers of God. (Mark 11:25; Luke 6:37-The Message).\nYet, spiritual discernment regarding the root of the behavior is very liberating. In fact, it creates a deeper understanding of how important it is to surrender our struggles to God. Jesus said on the cross, \u0026ldquo;Forgive them, for they DO NOT KNOW what they do! (Luke 23:34) Demonic driven people DO NOT KNOW what they do! That\u0026rsquo;s the basic truth regarding demonic possession. They are blinded by demonic forces. Do not get into an argument, or attempt to reason with a demonic possessed individual! As in the case of Jesus\u0026rsquo; encounters with demons mentioned in the Gospels, a person may be possessed by demons multiple times; on and off; on and off during a whole life that has not been totally surrendered to God. Demonic driven behavior requires GOD\u0026rsquo;S INTERVENTION. Drugs, alcohol, religion, obsessions, illusions, and negative thoughts, are venues the Devil uses to posses a person.\nThe entire backdrop to the original story of sin and how humanity needed a savior is a preemption of a higher authority in the spiritual realm that is dark, evil, and damaging to the heart and psyche of humans. Between the Creator who is God and humanity who was born in God’s image there are many unseen entities created by God as angelic hosts. These, too, had the option of free will and the capacity to rebel against God. Those that did so, the angelic beings that rebelled and remain in rebellion against God, are called “fallen angels”, “demonic spirits”, or “demons”. The highest power among the fallen angels is Lucifer, or Satan. He was one of the greatest angelic beings in heaven, but in thinking himself higher than he ought, he rebelled and was cast out of Heaven. Unlike humanity and the rest of physical life on Earth, God imposed no veil over the eyes of angelic beings—they have direct visibility to see God’s self-expression and the rest of the spiritual realm—but at the same time God gave them no plan of salvation. Instead, He gave rebellious angels limited freedom for a limited time to rule over the world, so that they may put humanity to the test. (Job 1:6-12).\nIt was a demonic angelic being, or Lucifer himself, that deceived humans from the beginning, as they ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The Bible uses the metaphorical reference to “the serpent” in describing Satan.\nNow the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’” “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil. (Genesis 3:1-5)\nSo the world we live in consists of physical beings that are seen with physical eyes and also spiritual beings that are unseen, and all of the spiritual beings serve God in one way or another, directly or indirectly. The angelic beings that remain true to God’s throne thrive in God’s presence, and serve Him in different ways, including by protecting, guiding, or comforting human beings. The angelic beings that are in rebellion are out only for themselves and their hierarchical order, and human beings make ideal hosts and outlets for their rebellion. They aim to steal the attention of people away from God’s plan and cause humans to deviate or to also rebel. They are constantly scouring the Earth looking for vulnerable, weak people to ensnare with lies, deception, physical injury and sickness, and destructive habits and behaviors. In many cases they possess human beings. In fact, weak humans make ideal hosts for demonic beings, in part because humans are so engaged with the created world, but also because demonic entities love exacerbating the rebellion of creation against the Creator.\nBut angelic beings are not equal to God, they are not above God, they are sons of God. This is to be taken quite literally; angels do not multiply, they have no mothers who bear them through pregnancy, they are or were created on a whim through the creative power of God’s own self-expression. Jesus, who is the self-expression and personality of God come in the flesh, cast out many demons from people while he walked on Earth in the flesh. Indeed, he instructed his disciples that he had given his disciples power over demonic forces.\nAnd He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. (Luke 9:1) Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you. (Luke 10:19)\nSome might argue that these words were apportioned for a time, specifically for the one or few outings they had, that month. Actually, the disciples were in training. One does not train for throwaway knowledge. These disciples were learning how to thrive under the jurisdiction and authority of the throne of God, because God was launching a new covenant with mankind. Ultimately, all power over all demonic forces must obey the throne of Jesus.\nAnd Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me” (Matthew 28:18)\nIf nothing else, we can at least glean from this that Jesus can deliver us from anything, because He has authority over everything, and nothing is better than or greater than or more powerful than Himself. Therefore, if we intimately know Jesus and we have a complete and total dependence upon Him and our eyes are fixated upon Him, we should never be vulnerable to suffering successful attacks from demonic entities. Our responsibility in all of this, therefore, as Jesus’ own, is to pay attention to the spiritual realm and to spiritual forces, but to never allow our eyes to fall away from Jesus, and to call upon the authority of Jesus in the presence of evil.\nThe throne of Jesus can have immediate impact upon and relief from all manifestations of demonic activity, including perverted thinking, malice, hatred, extreme fear, destructive thrill-seeking, or harmful addictions.\nAnd that about wraps it up. God is strong, and he wants you strong. So take everything the Master has set out for you, well-made weapons of the best materials. And put them to use so you will be able to stand up to everything the Devil throws your way. This is no afternoon athletic contest that we’ll walk away from and forget about in a couple of hours. This is for keeps, a life-or-death fight to the finish against the Devil and all his angels.\nKeep a cool head. Stay alert. The Devil is poised to pounce, and would like nothing better than to catch you napping. Keep your guard up. You’re not the only ones plunged into these hard times. It’s the same with Christians all over the world. So keep a firm grip on the faith. The suffering won’t last forever. It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ—eternal and glorious plans they are!—will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, he does.\n"}).add({id:22,href:"/docs/book/final-test/",title:"The Final Test",description:"These are the words of Jesus Himself.

A deep, intimate knowledge means He is aware of you! He watches you! Someone asked me the other day, \u0026ldquo;How would describe the Good News?\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;The Good News is that God forgave you before the beginning of the world. God begs you to let Him love you. Once you surrender to Him, He takes over and God transforms your life! No more worries about salvation and eternal life! God declares you a full members of His Kingdom, now, and forever!\u0026rdquo; Isn\u0026rsquo;t that Good News? So opposite to what religion teaches! The Good News are liberating!\nHow can you tell if you really love God? # Better yet, how can you tell if you are really grateful to God for His extravagant love?\nHere are some indicators of whether you are grateful to God for His love, and you just long to be a part of His presence and radical movement on this earth!\n  You will long for personal communion with Him. When you really love someone, you like to spend time with him or her. And if you really love God, then you will want to spend time with God. Reading the Bible. Praying. Meditating. Talking to Him. Out gratefulness and love, you will seek to commune with Him! That\u0026rsquo;s what lovers do!\n  You will love the things that He loves. We know what God loves by what He has declared in His Word. The psalmist said, \u0026ldquo;I rejoice at Your word as one who finds great treasure\u0026rdquo; (Psalm 119:162). If you seek to find out what God loves, He will reveal it to you.\n  You will see SIN the way God sees it!. SIN is a condition that only God can heal you from. SIN is not just the \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; things you do, but the \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; things you do without God! SIN is a condition not just acts! Morality, correct behavior, irreproachable ethics, without God, equals nothing! The \u0026ldquo;new birth\u0026rdquo; experience is what the two words describe\u0026hellip; A totally new beginning, driven by the transforming presence of God! (Romans 7, 8)\n  You will love other followers of God. In 1 John 3:14 we read, \u0026ldquo;We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t say that you love God while you harbor hatred toward fellow believers.\n  Your will gladly invest time, energy and money in God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom expansion. A lover of God can not shut up. He has to share God with others. A lover of God is a witness to the power and the love of God!\n  You will look forward to the weekly gathering of followers of God.\n  You will long for the Second coming of Jesus. The apostle Paul wrote, \u0026ldquo;Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing\u0026rdquo; (2 Timothy 4:8). A follower of God who loves God, is also looking forward, with a sense of anticipation, to Christ\u0026rsquo;s return. The world will be in a chaotic confusing mess until Jesus Christ returns to make everything right again.\n  You will keep His 10 commandments. Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me . . .\u0026rdquo; (John 14:21). If you love God, then you will do what He says. How can you obey God\u0026rsquo;s commandments? By accepting God\u0026rsquo;s power in your life! You will never be able to keep perfectly God\u0026rsquo;s commandments! But in His power you will!\n  If you love God, the proof will be in your actions and motivations.\n"}).add({id:23,href:"/docs/book/the-final-last-days/",title:"The Final Last Days",description:"You are experiencing the final days of \u0026ldquo;last days\u0026rdquo; of this age.

Jesus is coming back in the flesh very soon! The Bible gave us a lot of clues about when the end of this age will come, and those signs are all around us! This is very exciting! However, we must wake up\nFor as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. ‘Immediately after the distress of those days ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. (Matthew 24:27-34)\nThere are 4 kids of responses to the \u0026ldquo;time of the end.\u0026rdquo;\n1) People who deny and refuse to get involved in prophecies regarding the \u0026ldquo;time of the end.\u0026rdquo; This is the majority of the world. All 5 largest world religions refuse to deal with \u0026ldquo;time of the end\u0026rdquo; because of its complication, fear elements, and in credible diversity. In live in earthquake land here in Southern California. Yet, the majority of people live like nothing will ever happen, and if the subject gets too serious, they walk away. That\u0026rsquo;s the same response to anything catastrophic predicted in the future. Why do you think Noah preached 120 years, and NO ONE except his family were saved? Same today. (Mathew 24:37)\n2) People who obsess over \u0026ldquo;time of the end\u0026rdquo; prophecies, theories of interpretation, charts, conspiracy theories, esoteric information, date setting, and predictions. Very often behind this drive there is an obsession for tangibility, idolatrous knowledge, and let\u0026rsquo;s face it an intense lust for results. Fear creates results, followers, and money. People pay for pleasure and fear.\n3) Denominations, cults, and groups who use \u0026ldquo;time of the end\u0026rdquo; information to elevate themselves and define WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG. This approach creates a \u0026ldquo;we versus the rest\u0026rdquo; mindset that is also very reassuring. Group mind is very powerful.\n4) Those honestly accept the main prophetic pillars that point to the \u0026ldquo;time of the end,\u0026rdquo; but do not obsess over details. How do you know when you are stepping into a territory not blessed by God? Simple. When 27 other \u0026ldquo;time of the end\u0026rdquo; experts are fighting regarding details and they all disagree on the details.\nSeek to understand and believe the signs of the times as presented in the Bible. Do not obsessed over details because I promise you, for every detail you believe, someone else will come and tell you, you are wrong!\nSatan\u0026rsquo;s Final Last Days Deception # Your BRAIN, your MIND is the territory the devil seeks; control of the physical just follows the control of your BRAIN.\nLook at 2 Corinthians 4:4.\nWhat part of your SELF does the devil blind? Its not the physical eyes, HE IS AFTER YOUR BRAIN, your MIND! He wants to slowly align those 100 billion neurons to work efficiently for him, until he gets total possession. The Greek word for mind is \u0026ldquo;novhma Noema\u0026rdquo;, which translates mental thought or perception, that which thinks. Here is where Satan fights for control. All for the purpose of blinding you from the truth of God. He uses a variety of tools, strategies, skills to win the battle of your brain.\nHow you THINK, the inner-person YOU are, guides your perceptions. Here is where Satan is at work, and here is where the Bible warns us to set our guard. God’s word implores with you to protect YOUR BRAIN against the ways of this world, which are demonic in nature.\nSatan and his fallen-angels, through the proxy of fallen-humanity, battle for the control of YOUR BRAIN. When a person surrenders to God, their perceptions change, because the Spirit of God, the presence of God, the Holy Spirit is now GUIDING THE BRAIN, THE THOUGHTS, THE MIND, THE WILL in a different direction. Satan looses total control over their mind. The kingdom of God has advanced on his territory.\n\u0026ldquo;The heart is hopelessly dark and deceitful, a puzzle that NO ONE can figure out.\nBut I, God, search the heart and examine the mind. I get to the heart of the human. I get to the root of things. I treat them as they really are, not as they pretend to be.\u0026rdquo;\nYou see, Friend, while religion, morality and culture define what\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, God always goes deeper! The world says, \u0026ldquo;Do what your heart tells you. Follow your heart.\u0026rdquo; That is a creed believed by millions today. It is one of the great cultural myths of the Western world, a gospel proclaimed in many movies and songs and television programs and stories. People spend hours watching movies that promote one of the devil\u0026rsquo;s most accepted myths! Not only that, what they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dare do openly, because of the judgmental legalism and morality they would face, they live, accept, and caress in the depths of their hearts. Thus, their walk with God is incongruent! They follow religion, but in their fantasy world, they follow the devil! God says, \u0026ldquo;Your heart is deceitful.\u0026rdquo; Even, when it looks like you are obeying the 10 commandments, and have the truth, and follow the truth, and do the religious stuff. (Rich Young Ruler Mark 10:17-27) Under all of that, there is a deeper reality. The condition of your heart is what God looks at! Your heart matters to God, more than your outward behavior! Your heart must be filled by God\u0026rsquo;s presence, and His drive, to do His will, then your behavior will reflect it! I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in judging externals. It is deceiving. Religion does that all the time. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s adultery, homosexuality, abortion or whatever! Externals are always deceiving. When a person surrenders to God, and accepts Him in his/her heart, God changes people from the inside out. There is peace. There is harmony. The fruit of the Spirit blossoms fully. Galatians 5 (The Message) We need a higher standard of authority than our heart, our feelings, our emotions. A higher standard of authority than mere opinion from the culture, from morality, legalism, and religion. We must ask God to seek the depths of our hearts. That takes time. It takes a walk with God. It takes listening to God. It takes a commitment to reading God\u0026rsquo;s Word in its totality. It takes prayer. And above all things it takes a humble heart! The problem we have today is a watered-down gospel. Religion has replaced the radical call of Jesus to look deep into our hearts. That\u0026rsquo;s why religion is so quick to judge some sins such as adultery, and very, very, very slow to call on the deeper sins of the heart: namely, pride, greed, materialism, money obsession, and insensitivity towards poverty, and injustice. Because of that, many have a watered-down understanding of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, a follower of God. We have Christians who have become so much like the world, that the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t even want to become like them. Remember Peter? And this is the truth! Have you ever watched Christians in \u0026ldquo;worldly\u0026rdquo; circles trying to \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; and be \u0026ldquo;cool.\u0026rdquo;? Here is the truth, Friend. What was considered normal followship of Christ in the first and the second century, before Christianity became an institution, would be considered RADICAL by today\u0026rsquo;s standards. But that is what we need today: RADICAL FOLLOWERS OF GOD. To put it another way, we need followers of God that are willing to stand for God no matter what. We need followers of God that know that the only real TRUTH is the one God reveals in the heart! God transforms the human heart. The human heart without God is deceiving. I see all day long the results of behavior caused by the human heart. Give God a chance, Friend! Instead of trying to accommodate the Word of God to our changing culture, we need to accommodate our culture to the unchanging Word of God.\nWhat is the Apocalypse? # We live in a time when increasingly numbers of people, from all walks of life, are familiar with the phrase, \u0026ldquo;time of the end,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;apocalypse.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are 5 things you need to know about the time of the end.\n1) The condition of the world before the coming of Jesus. Matthew 24:12\n“In the confusion, [time of the end] lying preachers [false religion] will come forward and deceive a lot of people. For many others, the overwhelming spread of evil will do them in—nothing left of their love but a mound of ashes.\u0026quot; (The Message) \u0026ldquo;The love of most will grow cold.\u0026rdquo; (NIV)\nThree aspects deserve attention from this passage.\nFalse religion\nThe five major religions of the world are infested with errors and erroneous concepts about God. Religion is driving much of the confusion of the world. I define religion: \u0026ldquo;As the human attempt to conceptualize, systematize, define, anthropomorphize (project humanity on God), use God to drive human behavior, create morality, question Him, (agnosticism), or reject His existence (atheism). All for the purpose to affect human behavior. Religion begins with the human search. A relationship with God begins with Him reaching out to humanity. Thus, He invites us FIRST to let Him love us.\nI believe there are followers of God all around the world, who are hearing the voice of God and following Him in their personal lives. These people come from all walks of life, all religions and persuasions.\nChaotic conditions\n  Climate change, natural disasters\n  Hostilities among nations\n  Military or militarized conflicts in the US, and geopolitical regions of the words\n  Economic crisis\n  Conflicts between the \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; (the majority of the world, poor, oppressed), and the right (1%, 10%, greed, political powers)\n  Pandemics\n  Hopelessness and loss of meaning\n  Most people will lose their ability to love, and accept love.\nThe absence of love will increasingly create the vacum for violence to escalate at all levels. Loveless marriages, divorce, generational tensions, lack of compassion, greed, and demonic forces driving people to do the unthinkable.\nWord of Jesus about conditions in the time of the end. Matthew 24 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;Later as he [Jesus] was sitting on Mount Olives, his disciples approached and asked him, “Tell us, when are these things going to happen? What will be the sign of your coming, that the time’s up?”\n[False religion] \u0026ldquo;Jesus said, “Watch out for doomsday deceivers. Many leaders are going to show up with forged identities, claiming, ‘I am Christ, the Messiah.’ They will deceive a lot of people.\u0026rdquo;\n[Armed conflicts] \u0026ldquo;When reports come in of wars and rumored wars, keep your head and don’t panic. This is routine history; this is no sign of the end. Nation will fight nation and ruler fight ruler, over and over.\u0026rdquo;\n[Natural disasters] \u0026ldquo;Famines and earthquakes will occur in various places. This is nothing compared to what is coming.\u0026rdquo;\n[Persecution - Violence] “They are going to throw you to the wolves and kill you, everyone hating you because you carry my name. And then, going from bad to worse, it will be dog-eat-dog, everyone at each other’s throat, everyone hating each other.\u0026rdquo;\n[False religion - Chaos - Absence of love] “In the confusion, lying preachers will come forward and deceive a lot of people. For many others, the overwhelming spread of evil will do them in—nothing left of their love but a mound of ashes.\n[Key to victory for followers of God] “Staying with it—that’s what God requires. Stay with it to the end. You won’t be sorry, and you’ll be saved. All during this time, the good news—the Message of the kingdom—will be preached all over the world, a witness staked out in every country. And then the end will come.\u0026rdquo;\n[AntiChrist-Mark of the beast-Religio-political allegiance (Daniel-Revelation)] “But be ready to run for it when you see the monster of desecration set up in the Temple sanctuary. The prophet Daniel described this. If you’ve read Daniel, you’ll know what I’m talking about. If you’re living in Judea at the time, run for the hills; if you’re working in the yard, don’t return to the house to get anything; if you’re out in the field, don’t go back and get your coat. Pregnant and nursing mothers will have it especially hard.\n[Chaotic conditions as never seen-God will put an end before the world self-destroys] “This is going to be trouble on a scale beyond what the world has ever seen, or will see again. If these days of trouble were left to run their course, nobody would make it. But on account of God’s chosen people, [you, Friend] the trouble will be cut short.\n[False religion] “If anyone tries to flag you down, calling out, ‘Here’s the Messiah!’ or points, ‘There he is!’ don’t fall for it. Fake Messiahs and lying preachers are going to pop up everywhere. Their impressive credentials and dazzling performances will pull the wool over the eyes of even those who ought to know better. But I\u0026rsquo;ve given you fair warning. So if they say, ‘Run to the country and see him arrive!’ or, ‘Quick, get downtown, see him come!’ don’t give them the time of day.\u0026quot;\n[The truth about the Second Coming of Jesus] \u0026ldquo;The Arrival of the Son of Man [Jesus] isn\u0026rsquo;t something you go to see. HE COMES like swift lightning to you! Whenever you see crowds gathering, think of carrion vultures circling, moving in, hovering over a rotting carcass. You can be quite sure that it’s not the living Son of Man pulling in those crowds.\u0026rdquo;\n[The Second Coming of Jesus] “Then, the Arrival of the Son of Man! [Jesus] IT WILL FILL THE SKIES—NO ONE WILL MISS IT. UNREADY people all over the world, OUTSIDERS to the splendor and power, will raise a huge lament as they watch the Son of Man blazing out of heaven. At that same moment, he’ll dispatch his angels with a trumpet-blast summons, pulling in God’s chosen from the four winds, from pole to pole. [What a spectacular description]\n[SIGNS of the Second Coming of Jesus is what we have, NOT A SPECIFIC DATE. Watch out for obsessive date setting] “Take a lesson from the fig tree. From the moment you notice its buds form, the merest hint of green, you know summer’s just around the corner. So it is with you: When you see all these things, you’ll know he’s at the door. Don’t take this lightly. I’m not just saying this for some future generation, but for all of you. This age continues until all these things take place. Sky and earth will wear out; my words won’t wear out.\n“But the exact day and hour? No one knows that, not even heaven’s angels, not even the Son. Only the Father knows.\u0026quot;\n[Conditions in the culture by the time of Jesus\u0026rsquo; Second Coming] \u0026ldquo;The Arrival of the Son of Man [Jesus] will take place in times like Noah’s. Before the great flood EVERYONE was carrying on as USUAL, HAVING A GOOD TIME right up to the day Noah boarded the ark. They KNEW NOTHING—until the flood hit and swept everything away.\u0026rdquo;\n[The Second Coming of Jesus will happen all of a sudden] “The Son of Man’s Arrival will be like that: Two men will be working in the field—one will be taken, one left behind; two women will be grinding at the mill—one will be taken, one left behind.\u0026quot;\n[Warning from Jesus] \u0026ldquo;So stay AWAKE, ALERT. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DAY YOUR MASTER WILL SHOW UP. But you do know this: You know that if the homeowner had known what time of night the burglar would arrive, he would have been there with his dogs to prevent the break-in. Be vigilant just like that. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE SON OF MAN IS GOING TO SHOW UP.\u0026rdquo;\n[I have to confess I get very impatient with people who try so hard to predict the time of Jesus\u0026rsquo; coming. You can read books and books of conspiracy theories and ignore what Jesus\u0026rsquo; said! NO ONE KNOWS! You have no idea!]\n[This is for Pastors and leaders] “Who here qualifies for the job of overseeing the kitchen? A PERSON THE MASTER CAN DEPEND ON TO FEED THE WORKERS ON TIME EACH DAY. SOMEONE THE MASTER CAN DROP IN ON UNANNOUNCED AND ALWAYS FIND HIM DOING HIS JOB. A God-blessed man or woman, I tell you. It won’t be long before the Master will put this person in charge of the whole operation.\u0026quot;\n[I want to be this person. People who tend to obsess about the events of Jesus coming, prediction, date setting, conspiracy theories should be avoided. Do what God has called you to do. Fulfill your purpose. Live every day as if Jesus won\u0026rsquo;t come for 1.000 more years, be ready as He would come back tomorrow. That\u0026rsquo;s the key. By the way, most of \u0026ldquo;time of the end terrorists, and expert speculators\u0026rdquo; (Pastors, teachers), are making very good money out of scaring people, and satisfying an obsessive, neurotic need to know\u0026hellip; ]\n[Religious hypocrites] “But if that person only looks out for himself, and the minute the Master is away does what he pleases—abusing the help and throwing drunken parties for his friends—the Master is going to show up when he least expects it and make hash of him. He’ll end up in the dump with the hypocrites, out in the cold shivering, teeth chattering.”\nNothing can be more clear than the teachings of Jesus regarding the time of the end.\n2) The mark of God\u0026rsquo;s followers in the time of the end. John 13:35 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;This is how EVERYONE will recognize that you are my disciples—when they see the love you have for each other.”\nNotice it\u0026rsquo;s not a message, doctrine or a teaching that will tell the world who are God\u0026rsquo;s people. But the witness of LOVE, compassion, and care.\nFollowers of God to let God love them, which then enables them to love others, have compassion, and not respond violently to persecution and attacks from the world. LOVE and the absence of it will divide the world in two groups: The majority of the world will be unable to love, and a small minority will continue to respond in compassion, and love to people, regardless of adverse circumstances. Most Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;will quit loving\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 24:12)\nWe are told by historians of the early church called \u0026ldquo;The Way,\u0026rdquo; (followers of Jesus. Acts 9:2 is the first mention of this church out of 6 times), that the way in which pagans and secular people KNEW followers of Jesus, was by the way they expressed love. They way they cared for each other. An anonymous onlooker from that epoch is said to have described them as, \u0026ldquo;Look how they love each other\u0026rdquo; They were truly a community of love and compassion. Imagine a community of wealthy people and poor, followers of God, who sell all their real estate properties, possessions, expensive cars and take the money back so everyone will have their needs taken acre of. That\u0026rsquo;s what marked that early church. Capitalism, individualism, and the greed of Wall Street would have shocked them!\nI know there are people who think this \u0026ldquo;love\u0026rdquo; concept is too soft. There must be some substance, some doctrine that will distinguish followers of God in the time of the end.\nTo those who worry about legalistic issues, obedience, doctrines, and who \u0026ldquo;has the truth,\u0026rdquo; I say, \u0026ldquo;when you let God love you, you will obey out of love whatever God directs you to do.\u0026rdquo; Lovers don\u0026rsquo;t need lessons on how to love. A young mother learns very quickly how to love her baby. Love is a driving force.\n3) The specific events to take place between now and the Second Coming of Jesus are revealed to us in the Bible as prophetic statements. God has not left us without information about the time of the end.\n  Daniel 11, 12\n  The book of Revelation\n  Statements by Jesus\n  Statements by writers of the NT\n  There is: 1) a prophetic message in the Bible followers of God must understand, and 2) a prophetic worldwide movement composed by people who choose to follow God. (This is not to be confused with \u0026ldquo;time of the end terrorists,\u0026rdquo; paranoid fanatics, conspiracy theories, obsessive date setting, and fear-mongering predictions.) Fear is not from God. Love is (1 John 4:18).\nWe must keep in mind what matters! The devil is in the details. If you are a follower of God, He will reveal to you what you must do. God will not leave you at the mercy of you understanding volumes of volumes of details. You must know the main sings and be ready to follow God, not the world.\n4) There will be a critical decision followers of God will have to make before the Second Coming of Jesus. Revelation 14: 9-11 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;A third Angel followed, shouting, warning, \u0026lsquo;If anyone worships the Beast and its image [false religion] and takes the mark on forehead or hand, that person will drink the wine of God’s wrath, prepared unmixed in his chalice of anger\u0026hellip; No respite for those who worship the Beast and its image, who take the mark of its name.” MEANWHILE, the saints stand passionately patient, keeping God’s commands, staying faithful to Jesus.\u0026rdquo;\nI believe, rooted in intense study of Biblical prophecies that the world will be called to go back to God, due to the calamities falling upon the earth. In a last desperate attempt to calm the wrath of God, religion will call the masses to go back to church. A Sunday law will be legalized and imposed as a sign of loyalty to God. Except for the fact that \u0026ldquo;Sunday keeping\u0026rdquo; is the mark of false religion. Those who observe the commandments of God will be called by God to observe Sabbath (Saturday) as a day of worship. That will signal the beginning of fierce persecution of followers of God by religion and political powers. Make no mistake about Sunday keeping. The Catholic Church has clearly acknowledge from the beginning the Church had the authority to change God\u0026rsquo;s day of rest for a Church\u0026rsquo;s chosen day. The Catholic catechism is clear. The reformation kept Sunday among all the reforms, and evangelicals today twist Scriptures, the Bible to say that Sabbath is not abiding for followers of God. I can dialogue with Catholics because the issue is not Sunday or Sabbath (Saturday) but the authority of the church and the Bible. For evangelical Christians the issue is hermeneutical maneuvering, and distortion of the Biblical text.\nJust for your information I post one statement which shows that Protestants all follow the Catholic church.\n“The Bible everywhere enforces the sanctification of Saturday the seventh day of the week…You Protestants have to admit the authority of the Roman Catholic Church that is branded on you when you observe Sunday because you have no other authority for Sunday but that of the Roman Catholic Church.”- James Gibbons (American Catholic Cardinal, Virginia; July 23, 1834 – March 24, 1921)\n5) God\u0026rsquo;s promise to His people in the time of the end. Daniel 12: 1-3 (The Message)\nThis is a phenomenal promise for followers of God.\n“At that time [time of the end] Michael, [Jesus], the great prince who PROTECTS YOUR PEOPLE, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. BUT at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—WILL BE DELIVERED. Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. Those who are wise[a] will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.\u0026rdquo;\nNothing to fear, Friend! God will protect His people. There will probably be some that will die standing for God. The resurrection of saints will happen shortly after, and we will enter eternity. I am looking forward to meeting my Dad again. Loved ones who went to sleep believing in God. Friends who have gone to their rest already.\nAre you a follower of God Friend? Are you developing a relationship with Him, so when troubled times come you can hear His voice directing you?

This is not a new idea. It was predicted 2.000 years in a vision God gave the apostle John in the Island of Patmos.\nRevelation 13: 11-18\n\u0026ldquo;I saw ANOTHER Beastrising out of the ground. It had two horns like a lamb but sounded like a dragon when it spoke. (This \u0026ldquo;beast\u0026rdquo; in prophetic terms represents the USA as a world power). IT WAS A PUPPET OF THE FIRST BEAST, (The first beast has been traditionally understood to be the Catholic Church)\u0026hellip; (The second beast) made earth and everyone in it worship the FIRST BEAST, which had been healed of its deathblow.\u0026rdquo; (This last description of the first beast provides us with a historical anchor to know what it means)\nThe deathblow inflicted on the first beast has always been considered the 59 years the Vatican was invaded as a \u0026ldquo;Papal independent State\u0026rdquo; and invalidated on September 20th, 1870. The deathblow was the abolition of \u0026ldquo;church-state\u0026rdquo; kind of government. On February 11th, 1929, an historic treaty was signed between the Italian Government and the Vatican re-establishing the political power and diplomatic standing of the Catholic Church. Back to church-state kind of government. The agreement signed 70 years ago by Benito Mussolini and Cardinal Gasparri, on behalf of the King Victor Emmanuel III and Pope Pius XI, restored the full diplomatic and political power of the Holy See of Rome. And today, all the world indeed \u0026ldquo;wonders\u0026rdquo; at the revived power of the Roman Catholic Church, which is the epitome of CHURCH and STATE combined in one institution with ambassadors all over the world, its own bank, government entities, and a major player in global politics all under the headship of a political-religious person, namely, the Pope.\nContinues John in the Book of revelation:\n\u0026ldquo;This second Beast (The USA) worked magical signs, dazzling people by making fire come down from Heaven. It used the magic it got from the Beast to dupe earth dwellers, getting them to make an IMAGE OF THE BEST that received the deathblow and lived. It was able to animate the image of the Beast (give power to the first beast) so that it talked, and then arrange that anyone not worshiping the Beast would be killed. It forced all people, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or forehead. Without the mark of the name of the Beast or the number of its name, it was impossible to buy or sell anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Solve a riddle: Put your heads together and figure out the meaning of the number of the Beast. It’s a human number: 666.\u0026rdquo;\nThe second beast (The USA) will have the appearance of a lamb (Revelation 13:11), which means it will \u0026ldquo;appear to be a follower of God.\u0026rdquo; However, in reality he is an impostor and a deceiver. The true identity of the second beast, is the one of the false prophet. His campaign to unite the world’s religions will ultimately lead people of all faiths to come together for the purpose of WORSHIPING THE FIRST BEAST, THE ANTICHRIST.\nThis is what you need to catch. The model of church-state government under the papacy, will be implemented in the United States under the direction of the Vatican. That\u0026rsquo;s what the prophecy says.\nEllen White, prophet of God, said 150 years ago the following:\n\u0026ldquo;WHEN the leading churches of the United States, uniting in such points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall INFLUENCE THE STATE TO ENFORCE their decrees and to sustain their institutions, THEN Protestant America will have formed an IMAGE TO THE ROMAN HIERARCHY, and the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters inevitably result.” (Great Controversy, p, 445)\nOnly a \u0026ldquo;political-religious\u0026rdquo; leader, following the the model of the Vatican, like the United States could fulfill the requirements of having the appearance of a lamb and leading the world in worship.\nSo believers have been warned in advance to be on the lookout for this movement which I believe is happening very quickly now. Our alarms should be blowing when we see someone taking actions to unite the religions of the world. However, since the Bible does not tell us the dates we are instructed to be on the alert, be sober, aware of the schemes of the devil. We are warned not to be spiritually asleep like those who are in darkness.\nThe Lord Jesus warned his followers, “Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 25:13). So those who are committed to obeying God should be paying close attention to the events happening in the world around them.\nToday we see a religious leader taking action to unify the religions of the world in ways that are unprecedented. His name is Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church.\nPope Francis appears to be on a crusade to unite the religions of the world into one. He started fast from the beginning and has not slowed down. Since being elected Pope on March 13 2013, he has launched initiatives to reconcile differences between leaders of every major religion, including longstanding rifts between Christian denominations.\nI believe the United States will follow the direction of the Pope in all political affairs, and the direction of the government, beginning September 23, 2015. In fact, I am convinced the next Presidential election will be heavily influenced by Pope Francis\u0026rsquo; agenda. The United States will order the world to follow the message of the Pope regarding the following issues:\n  The environment\n  Socio-economic issues. Compassion. What could be more \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; than to cover the poor, eliminate discrimination, and create a sense of openness to all people. Forgiveness for abortion. Forgiveness for divorce.\n  A message of love and compassion for sinners which will unite all religions. De-emphasize differences and proclaim the love, the mercy and the forgiveness of God.\n  God\u0026rsquo;s last message to the world is a message of compassion, love, mercy and grace.\n\u0026ldquo;Legalistic\u0026rdquo; denominations with cultic tendencies like to speak of JUDGMENT. I believe in judgment. But if the judgment of God is not framed by GOD\u0026rsquo;S LOVE, His judgment will be used to create FEAR and religious behavior modification which is not healthy.\nFollowers of God must be very cautious in calling Pope Francis \u0026ldquo;demonic.\u0026rdquo; You don\u0026rsquo;t know that! God may be using this man to share God\u0026rsquo;s last message to the world. There is a strong confrontation around the world right now between compassion, and intolerance. Intolerance is often used under the umbrella of religion. Ask God to give you a spirit of discernment.\n I believe the world will become involved in a \u0026ldquo;new spiritual revival\u0026rdquo; like we have never seen before. Under the umbrella or love and compassion there will be great deception and confusion between the TRUE REDEMPTIVE TRANSFORMING LOVE OF GOD, and a SUPERFICIAL RELIGIOUS LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF UNITY.\n The reason why I believe this point is so important it\u0026rsquo;s because God\u0026rsquo;s last message to the world is HIS LOVE\u0026hellip; Inviting people to LET HIM LOVE THEM, and allowing the transforming power of His grace to follow Him. I have said this for years. THE DEVIL and GOD will preach the \u0026ldquo;SEEMINGLY SAME MESSAGE\u0026rdquo; to the world, and the ones who will know the difference will be those who have a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, away from religion and legalistic dogma.\n\u0026ldquo;All the world needs is LOVE\u0026rdquo; will sound like true religion. There is false love and true love. You can only be a true lover if you let God love you, FIRST!\nThis is important to acknowledge.\nThere will be great tension between RELIGIOUS LEGALISM on one extreme, (Disenchanted people fighting a religious battle), THE ONE WORLD RELIGION that will influence governments and political moves at all levels, and a true RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD which calls for true loyal love to Him and His commandments, even unto death. Matthew 25:12 is about to begin its major fulfillment:\nDue to FALSE RELIGION, (The ONE WORLD RELIGION. Many in the religions of the world will be disenchanted and will open up to God\u0026rsquo;s love and grace), and the chaos, violence, environmental disasters, and the confusion of the world, MOST people will lose their ability to love and be loved.\n  The world will become a jungle of conflict BETWEEN the absence of LOVE on one extreme, and FALSE LOVE, driven by fear, on the other extreme.\n  Perhaps a major global attack against ISIS and Muslims who do not surrender to the ONE WORLD RELIGION.\n  A possible economic global crash.\n  Persecution against those who remain loyal to God, and refuse to follow the ONE WORLD RELIGION.\n  This message of unity has been the ongoing theme by Pope Francis in meeting after meeting, and nation after nation. Pope Francis has not only sought unity among Catholics, but has ventured much farther than any previous Pope in reaching out to people of other religions. This is a pre-requisit for the second beast, the United States, to call the world to follow the Pope.\n\u0026ldquo;And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 13:12)\nBelievers everywhere should be watching and praying, on the alert, sober and fully awake for the devil comes craftily, cloaked as a lamb. Vigilant but not rooted in FEAR, legalism and a judgmental spirit.\nRejoicing because the end is near. Sharing the GOOD NEWS of God\u0026rsquo;s love with neighbors, family. Loving people, expressing compassion, praying for miracles of transformation. Keeping our marriages and families together under the umbrella of God\u0026rsquo;s grace, healing power, and LOVE.\nThe DEVIL and GOD will be preaching the \u0026ldquo;seemingly same\u0026rdquo; message in the time of the end. That\u0026rsquo;s why it will be so confusing. The devil just wants to copy, imitate everything God does. The is the false light.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a misconception to believe that the DEVIL will be preaching LOVE, compassion, unification to the world, while GOD calls his followers to preach LEGALISM, RIGIDITY OF DOCTRINE AND DOGMA. I want you to catch the subtlety of what I am saying.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t put your TOTAL TRUST IN END-TIME PROPHECIES, the fear mongering details some Pastors and churches use to create obsessive addiction to details, and predictions of the end. This is all part of what I call RELIGION. Speculation and conspiracy theories run high in the realm of RELIGION. INSTEAD PUT YOUR TRUST IN GOD. Let God LOVE YOU, and develop a RELATIONSHIP with Him, by surrendering your life to Him! God will never let His people be deceived. Study prophecies for awareness without falling into human obsession!\nThe prostitute riding the beast. UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE AS ONE CONTROLLING WORLD POWER.\nRevelation 17 is delineated into two parts: (1) the vision (17:1–6a), in which John the revelator observes a woman who is depicted as a prostitute riding the beast; and (2) the audition (17:6b–18), in which the interpreting angel explains to John the meaning of the vision of the prostitute and the beast that carries her.\nIn the vision, John is invited to witness the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters, seductively deceiving the inhabitants of the earth (vv. 1, 2). This woman is subsequently identified as “ ‘Babylon the great, the mother of harlots’ ” (v. 5).1 In the Hebrew Scriptures, a prostitute symbolically refers to God’s people in their apostasy (Isa. 1:21; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16; 23; Hosea 3; 4). The portrayal of the prostitute in Revelation 17 shows that she represents an entity that was once faithful to God before aligning herself with the end-time opponent of God and His faithful remnant. Babylon is thus a corporate name for an end-time apostate entity.\nNote that the prostitute is first referenced to as sitting on “ ‘many waters’ ” (v. 1); however, when John actually sees her, she is seen as sitting on a scarlet beast (v. 3). This should not come as a surprise due to such a literary feature occurring regularly in the book (see Rev. 5:5, 6). Therefore, the waters and the beast are two symbols that represent the same reality. According to Revelation 17:5, the waters upon which the prostitute was seen symbolize UNION of the civil, secular, and political powers of the world. Remember I spoke about this in my last \u0026ldquo;Chats.\u0026rdquo; The book of Revelation points us in the direction of ONE WORLD RELIGION, CHURCH OR POWER that will control the destiny of the world.\nJeremiah 51:13 shows that “many waters” refers to the Euphrates River. Just as the ancient Babylon depended on the Euphrates River for its existence, so will the end-time Babylon depend on the civil, secular, and politi­cal powers of the world to enforce its plans and purposes.\nFurthermore, the beast stands as a symbol of a political power or system. That the prostitute Babylon sits (or rides) on the beast shows that this religious system will have control over these worldwide political powers at the end of time. End of the separation of church and state, and the \u0026ldquo;marriage\u0026rdquo; of state and church in one entity. Thus, the prophecy shows us that at the end of time, there will be a religious-political union when the political powers of the earth will unite with the end-time apostate religious system named Babylon.\nThe three phases of the beast, The beast that WAS, WHO IS NOT, and WHO IS TO COME.\nIn the second part of the chapter, John is described as greatly aston­ished when he sees the prostitute. He recognizes in her the woman that had fled into the wilderness in order to escape the persecution of the dragon during the prophetic 1,260-day period of the Middle Ages (Rev. 12:13, 14). In response to John’s astonishment, the interpreting angel promises to disclose the “ ‘mystery’ ” of the prostitute and of the scarlet beast that carries her as well as their function at the time of the end (Rev. 17:7).\nJohn describes the beast as the one that “ ‘was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss’ ” (v. 8). This identification of the beast brings to mind the divine title “ ‘who was and who is and who is to come’ ” (Rev. 4:8). Thus, this title identifies the beast as a parody of God. However, this tripartite formula also shows that the beast has passed through three phases of exis­tence. This, in turn, links the scarlet beast of Revelation 17 with the sea beast of Revelation 13 (cf. Rev. 13:1 with 17:3).2\n First, the beast “was.”  In other words, this beast existed in the past. The “was” phase of the beast refers to its activities during the prophetic period of 1,260 days or years (Rev. 13:5). The year A.D. 538 marked the beginning of this prophetic period when the church of western Europe, led by the Roman papacy, established itself as an ecclesiastical power and dominated the Western world throughout the Middle Ages. In our time characterized by religious tolerance, such statements can be regarded as harsh and unfair; but the present reality cannot erase the historical facts.\n Second, the beast came into its “is not” phase of existence in 1798 when, as a result of the events of the French Revolution, it sustained its deadly wound (Rev. 13:3).  This brought an end to the church’s oppressive political power. The beast disappeared for some time from the world’s scene, yet it survived.\n Third, with the healing of the deadly wound, the beast will resur­rect to life in full satanic rage against God’s faithful people. The prophecy thus shows that the religious-political oppressive system that dominated the world during the Middle Ages will be revived at the time of the end and will dominate the world as it did in the past.  This revival of the beast will fill the inhabitants of the world with awe and admiration (Rev. 13:8; 17:8b).\nTherefore, Revelation 17 clearly describes the sea beast of Revelation 13 at the time when its deadly wound has been healed. Upon this resur­rected beast, John sees the end-time prostitute Babylon sitting. Thus, the end-time religious system that will play a key role in the final conflict is a continuation of the religious-political power that harmed and oppressed God’s people during the prophetic 1,260-day period of the Middle Ages.\nI want you to catch this. Revelation tells us that THE TIME OF THE END WILL BE ALL ABOUT RELIGION. Religion will once again dominate and control politics as it did in the past, even if it\u0026rsquo;s for a short time.\nHowever, there is a noticeable difference between its power during the medieval period and the time of the end. While the sea beast, representing the medieval CHURCH, was a religious-political power, the SCARLET BEAST is exclusively a politi­cal power driven by the religious power. These two are distinct at the end of time.\nThe Seven Heads of the Beast # This brings us to our key passage of Revelation 17:9–11: “ ‘Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits, and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while. The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction.’ ”\nThe text opens with a call for “WISDOM” as a prerequisite to understanding the meaning of the heads of the beast. The wisdom that John calls for here is the same wisdom that was spoken of in connection with the number of the beast (Rev. 13:18). This wisdom refers to spiritual discern­ment that can only be imparted by the Holy Spirit, rather than through brilliant mental and intellectual ability (James 1:5). Only through this divinely imparted wisdom will the faithful be able to discern the true character of this end-time satanic power.\nAs we continue to read, we may see that the beast has seven heads like the red dragon (or Satan) of Revelation 12:3. The existence of the beast remains inseparable from its heads. Throughout history, the beast has solely ruled and been active through the agency of its heads. When one of the heads receives a deadly blow, the whole beast dies (cf. Rev. 13:12–14). This brings us to a need for a closer look as to what these heads represent.\n“‘The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits’ ” (Rev. 17:9). We see a new symbol added here. At first, we were told that the woman sat on “ ‘many waters’ ” (v. 1), and then, on the scarlet beast (v. 3); now, catch this\u0026hellip; the angel explains that she actually sits on seven mountains. The waters, the beast, and the mountains are different symbols for the civic, secular, and political powers (cf. v. 15) that will provide popular support to Babylon as the end-time apostate religious system.\nWe must keep in mind that Revelation does not deal with INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITIES, whether past or present, but RATHER with systems and world powers—whether political or religious.\nThe Greek word \u0026quot;oros\u0026quot; means “mountain,”not “hill,” as some translators suggest in order to show that the city of Rome, situated on seven hills, is in view here. However, since the seven mountains in Revelation 17 are successive, they cannot be interpreted in a literal manner. In the Old Testament, mountains often represent world powers or empires (Jer. 51:25; Ezek. 35:2–5; Dan. 2:35). For instance, the kingdom of Judah in the Old Testament is often referred to as Mount Zion (Ps. 48:1–3; Isa. 29:8).\nThe angel clearly does not refer to literal mountains since he immediately explains to John that these seven mountains actually represent “seven kings” (Rev. 17:10). However, these cannot be interpreted as individual kings, for at least three reasons.\n  First of all, we have established that Revelation does not deal with individual personalities but systems.\n  Second, these seven kings are equated with the seven mountains—a symbol of kingdoms or empires.\n  Third, in the Old Testament, “kings” is another expression for kingdoms or empires (Dan. 2:37–39; 7:17).\n  Seven Heads as Successive Empires # Based on biblical evidence, the interpretation that makes the most sense is that the seven mountains, upon which the prostitute Babylon sits, stand for the seven successive empires that dominated the world throughout history and through which Satan worked to oppose God.\nThese empires possessed common traits of religious-political governance and coercion, which they used to cause harm and persecute God’s people.\nAs the angel further explains to John from his time’s perspective, 5 of these kingdoms have fallen, (WAS), 1 (IS), and the 7th one would appear sometime in the future. As previously explained, this cryptic text has generated numerous speculative interpretations, primarily due to the interpreters’ failure to note that the meaning of these successive kingdoms was explained to John in the context of his own time—not ours. Nowhere in the text does it indicate that John was transported to another time; the angel simply explains to him what he had already seen previously in the vision.\nTHEREFORE, the key to decoding the meaning of these seven heads lies in the sixth kingdom, which is described as “IS.” This “is” refers to John’s time. John lived in the time of the sixth head—THE ROMAN EMPIRE. The five that had fallen were thus the empires that ruled the world and caused harm to God’s people prior to the time of John: (1) Egypt was the world power that enslaved and oppressed Israel, seeking to destroy her; (2) Assyria destroyed and scattered the ten tribes of Israel; (3) Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and exiled Judah; (4) Persia almost annihilated the Jews at the time of Esther; (5) Greece oppressed and tried to destroy the Jews through Antiochus Epiphanes.\nTHE SEVENTH KINGDOM that “HAS NOT YET COME” refers to the medieval papacy that, from John’s time perspective, would be manifested in the future from John’s time—after the fall of the Roman Empire. (PAPAL ROME).\nThe angel further explained that the scarlet beast itself is a part of the phase of the eighth head, the world power that is to come at the time of the end. Yet, it is one of the previously noted seven heads. Although this eighth head is one of the previous seven, it is considered a new power. Which of the seven? Most likely the seventh head, which previously experienced the deadly wound but comes back to life after its wound has healed.\nThis seventh power will reappear as the eighth head at the end of time and will exercise the same authority as it did during the Middle Ages. During the time of the eighth head, the scarlet beast carries the prostitute Babylon. We now live in the era of the seventh head, for the eighth head has not yet gained its power. However, it will appear on the world scene at the time of the end and will impose its rule on the inhabitants of the earth.\nThe EIGHT head must remain a \u0026ldquo;short time\u0026rdquo;\nCurrent misinterpretations of this phrase have construed the phrase to mean that the seventh pope will rule for a short amount of time. The Greek adjectival word for the temporal phrase “a short time” used here is \u0026quot;oligon,\u0026quot; which means “a short time” or “a little while.”\nThis word (Greek: oligon)is different from \u0026quot;micron,\u0026quot; used in Revelation to indicate shortness of time (see Rev. 6:11; 20:3). In contrast, Greek: \u0026quot;oligon\u0026quot; does not indicate a length of time but is rather used in a qualitative sense. For instance, Revelation 12:12 states that having been cast out of heaven, Satan realizes that he has only “ ‘a short time,\u0026rsquo; Greek: \u0026lsquo;[oligon kairon].’ But you see, ”this “short time” does not refer to a length of time, for it has been at least 6.000 years, perhaps much more, since Satan’s expulsion from heaven—another way of saying this, is that Satan’s \u0026ldquo;time has limits,\u0026rdquo; its has pre-determined time. Just as a person sentenced to death realizes that he or she only has “a short time” despite the fact that the execution may take place many years later.\nThis same meaning for the Greek word Greek: \u0026quot;oligon\u0026quot; is also found in Revelation 17:10. That the seventh power must remain for a short time does not point to the length of time—a short period of existence; rather, it is a different way of stating that the existence of this power is determined by God (“it must remain”) and that it will come to its end, as is in the case of Satan in Revelation 12:12. The seventh power will receive a deadly wound: an event that took place with the events of the French Revolution in 1798.\nHere is my strongest conviction about the time of the end and the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. When understood properly, the prophecies of Revelation have PRACTICAL PURPOSES AND APPLICATIONS: to teach us how to live today and prepare us for the future. NOT THE CREATION OF FEAR, AND SUPERIOR ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE that gives you an edge on the rest of the people. A RIGHT understanding of prophecy will inspire and motivate you to reach others with the gospel of God\u0026rsquo;s GRACE, not make you denominationally ARROGANT, full of idolatrous certainty. That is not the spirit of God!\n\u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s grace is not defined as God being forgiving to us even though we sin. GRACE IS WHEN GOD IS A SOURCE OF WHOLENESS, which makes up for my failings. My failings hurt me and others and even the planet, and God\u0026rsquo;s grace to me is that my brokenness is not the final word \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s that God makes beautiful things out of even my own shit. Grace isn\u0026rsquo;t about God creating humans and flawed beings and then acting all hurt when we inevitably fail and then stepping in like the hero to grant us grace - like saying, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s OK, I\u0026rsquo;ll be the good guy and forgive you.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s God saying, \u0026ldquo;I LOVE THE WORLD TOO MUCH TO LET YOUR SIN DEFINE YOU AND BE THE FINAL WORD. I am a God who makes all things new.” ― Nadia Bolz-Weber, \u0026ldquo;Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner\u0026rdquo;\nI believe there will be two churches in the last stretch of the \u0026ldquo;time of the end\u0026rdquo; before the Second Coming of Jesus. \u0026ldquo;The parable of the sheep and the goats: TIME OF THE END.\u0026rdquo; Very few Bible students see a prophetic message in this parable.\n1) All the world\u0026rsquo;s issues at a local and global level will all be about RELIGION. You must be aware of this!\nI know it sounds impossible, but we are slowly moving into that era.\nJust a careful listening at the events that took place this week in the USA as result of Pope Francis\u0026rsquo; visit, will give you a glimpse of the future.\nThe issues we face globally are geo-political conflicts, ecological, environmental, financial disintegration, violence, crime, family values, the increasing number of young people who choose to cohabit instead of marrying, issues of sexuality, pornography, drug abuse, injustice, the value of life, death penalty, euthanasia, incarceration, poverty, discrimination, xenophobia, immigration and disease, among the main themes shaping our political, cultural and global debate. You see, Friend, at the bottom of the global landscape, are the spiritual issues, the issues of the heart, the kind of relational life we choose to live.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s my conviction that soon or later, all those issues will fall under the umbrella of RELIGION. We are almost there. The 5 large religions of the world are speaking to those issues, and in some instances the conflicts we face are driven by religious motives, particularly in the case of the 3 Abrahamic religions which tend to be religions of violence. I believe Pope Francis this week bundled up together the major issues we face under the big themes of God, church, humanity, life, love, compassion, community and the urgency to \u0026ldquo;rebuild our home.\u0026rdquo;\n2) There will be a FALSE church with FALSE RELIGION. This is what Jesus and the Bible say.\n3) There will be a TRUE church (God\u0026rsquo;s church) composed by people who LET GOD LOVE THEM, and they respond to God and the world in LOVE and COMPASSION!\nFirst, let me deal with a religious misnomer, which rolls in the hallways of churches, cults, sects, and denominational gatherings which tend to obsess regarding the details of the time of the end.\n\u0026ldquo;Time of the end\u0026rdquo; experts often tend to define the final conflict of 2 opposite ideologies as a very clear set of beliefs and propositions. They love to do that!\n Such perspective provides people and members of those groups what I call an \u0026ldquo;idolatrous certainty.\u0026rdquo; What do I mean by \u0026ldquo;idolatrous\u0026rdquo;? A false sense of certainty which you worship as an idol. Like you go to an exam knowing exactly what will be asked of you, and you expect to know the answers to those questions. The whole emphasis is on dogma, beliefs, doctrines, behavior, \u0026ldquo;who is right and wrong,\u0026rdquo; and LEGALISM! Every word I wrote on my last statement is intended to be there.\n What The End Times Are Really All About # The MESSAGE of the false and the true church of God in the \u0026ldquo;time of the end\u0026rdquo; will be SIMILAR on the surface. Thus, causing an ocean of confusion!\nDoes this make sense? There would no confusion if the messages of both churches would be diametrically different, and clearly defined.\nRevelation 13:13 (NLT) says that the FALSE CHURCH will perform \u0026ldquo;astounding miracles, even making fire flash down to earth from the sky while everyone was watching.\u0026rdquo; Unless you are totally in tune with God, in a deep relationship with Him, you will be deceived by these manifestations of supernatural power. How will you know what is from God and what is not?\nMatthew 24:24 (The Message) says, \u0026ldquo;Fake Messiahs and lying preachers are going to pop up everywhere. Their impressive credentials and dazzling performances will pull the wool over the eyes of EVEN THOSE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER.\u0026rdquo;\nThis simply means that the \u0026ldquo;false religion/church\u0026rdquo; will not show up with manifestations and messages that are seemingly \u0026ldquo;contrary\u0026rdquo; to God\u0026rsquo;s message directly. It will be a subtle underground form of deception like what the \u0026ldquo;serpent did in the Garden of Eden with Eve.\u0026rdquo; (Genesis 3:1).\nIf God performs miracles, the devil will also perform miracles. If God calls people to worship Him, the devil will also show up encouraging people to worship a \u0026ldquo;false god.\u0026rdquo; If God says \u0026ldquo;I love you\u0026rdquo; the devil will show up and say, \u0026ldquo;I love you better!\u0026rdquo; If God shows up and says, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all by grace and grace alone, the devil will show up and say, \u0026ldquo;Ok, that means you are free to do whatever you want!\u0026rdquo; (Playing games with God is called legalism). The devil is a master at deception, lying and confusing the human mind.\nConfusion in the End Times # I need you to follow my thought on this, because before you know what is genuine and false you must be patient. God says that.\nI read and heard many people this last week getting ahead of God and saying Pope Francis is the \u0026ldquo;beast\u0026rdquo; of the book of Revelation and the multitudes following him are being deceived. I disagree vehemently. I believe that\u0026rsquo;s the spirit of legalism, and \u0026ldquo;me right/you wrong\u0026rdquo; spirit prevailing, which is not from God.\nHere is the parable Jesus used to stop all \u0026ldquo;religious experts\u0026rdquo; from hurrying up to predict what\u0026rsquo;s next, and judge motives.\nMatthew 13:24-30 (The Message)\n\u0026ldquo;He [Jesus] told another story. “God’s kingdom is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field. [The good farmer is God] That night, while his hired men were asleep, his enemy [The devil] sowed thistles all through the wheat and slipped away before dawn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When the first green shoots appeared and the grain began to form, the thistles showed up, too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The farmhands came to the farmer [God] and said, ‘Master, that was clean seed you planted, wasn’t it? Where did these thistles come from?’ “He answered, ‘Some enemy did this.’\n“The farmhands asked, ‘Should we weed out the thistles?’ [Notice the anxiety driving the farm workers. They wanted to clean up the field. They were anxious to define what was good and what was bad! They sound like preachers and religious people trying to define who is RIGHT and WRONG, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Such anxiety, presumptuous, and arrogant sense of superiority is not from God. Read God\u0026rsquo;s answer to those farm workers (preachers, denominations)]\n“He said, ‘NO, if you weed the thistles, you’ll pull up the wheat, too. LET THEM GROW TOGETHER\u0026hellip; [please notice the following] UNTIL HARVEST TIME. [Don\u0026rsquo;t miss the following statement]. THEN\u0026hellip; [WHO?, a denomination, preachers, time of the end experts, a religious sect? NO!] \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; [God] WILL INSTRUCT THE \u0026ldquo;HARVESTERS\u0026rdquo; TO PULL UP THE THISTLES and tie them in bundles for the fire, THEN GATHER THE WHEAT and put it in the barn.’”\nNotice the points of Jesus\u0026rsquo; parable. TWO FARMERS: A good one, and a bad one. THE FARM represents the world. THE FARMERS, the workers of the field paid to keep the soil good, watered, and in good condition. THE FARMERS see the difference between the wheat and the tares, and they want to clean up the field. The GOOD FARMER SAYS, \u0026ldquo;NO, don\u0026rsquo;t do it!\u0026rdquo;\nFriend, who are the harvesters? at the end of the age?\nThe original Greek, and most versions such as the NIV, say, \u0026ldquo;The HARVEST IS THE END OF THE AGE, and the HARVESTERS ARE (Greek: \u0026ldquo;ἄγγελοί\u0026rdquo; ) ANGELS\u0026rdquo; So, the \u0026ldquo;judgment\u0026rdquo; of God will happen at the end of the age, and until then, unless you are one of God\u0026rsquo;s angels specifically sent to be a harvester, you are not responsible for separating the wheat from the tares. Do I make sense?\u0026rdquo; This is a symbolic image of what will happen at the Second Coming of Jesus.\nI believe the subject of this parable is RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. This is Jesus\u0026rsquo; message told to people who were anxious to clean up the field! Have you met any religious person like that?\nReligious tolerance is about reserving judgment till the HARVESTER/S get the job done. We can till, we can garden, we can nurture, we can water, we can argue about whose wheat is the \u0026ldquo;wheatiest\u0026rdquo; or whose thistles is the \u0026ldquo;thistleiest,\u0026rdquo; (which is mostly what legalism is all about), BUT judgment of what is fruitless and what is fruitful must be left to the ONE who is greater than the farmers!\n God is the only ONE who will perform the final judgment. Don\u0026rsquo;t take God\u0026rsquo;s job into your own hands. Aren\u0026rsquo;t you glad, you are not in charge of pulling the tares from the field?\n The 5 parables are prophetic parables because they reveal and conceal the existential reality of the Kingdom of God on earth all the way from the time when Jesus told them to the disciples, to the time of the end.\nThe language of the 5 parables follows the \u0026ldquo;agro-bio-linguistic\u0026rdquo; mindset of the Hebrew/Aramaic milieu. God meant for His people to walk out unto the world and find manifestations of His universal principles in nature. He used the idea of a potter to explain how He wants to shape us. He used the symbol of the bread, light, salt, birds, plants, flowers, trees, soil, seeds, examples of nature. The parables of Jesus are not linear like the Hellenistic culture, but dynamically alive, rich in meaning, multifaceted, and subtle. They are meant to make you think. They are often counter-intuitive. All 5 parables of Matthew 13 profile from different angles the two churches at the \u0026ldquo;end of the age\u0026rdquo; prior to the coming of Jesus: namely the CHURCH OF GOD, His followers, and the FALSE CHURCH, those who reject His love.\nWheat and Weeds # \u0026ldquo;Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.\n“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’\n“‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”\n\u0026ldquo;Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “EXPLAIN TO US THE PARABLE OF THE WEEDS in the field.”\n\u0026ldquo;He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. [God in Jesus] (Daniel 7:13-14). The field is the WORLD, [not the church] and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. [Followers of God] The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the END OF THE AGE, [The Second Coming of Jesus] and the harvesters are angels.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Son of Man [God-Jesus] will send out his angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom [the kingdom of God] everything that causes sin and all who do evil. [Noticed that the harvesters will pull out the weeds first] They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\u0026ldquo;Then the RIGHTEOUS will shine like the sun in the \u0026ldquo;kingdom of their Father.\u0026rdquo; Whoever has ears, let them hear.\u0026rdquo;\n  The first thing I want you to notice is the fact that THE BAD SEEDS PLANTED BY THE ENEMY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WAS A MALICIOUS, TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE OWNER OF THE FARM\n  The second thing I want you to notice is the UNUSUAL PARADIGM OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD!\n  The third thing I want you to notice in this parable is the NATURE OF THE WEED.\n  The New American Standard Bible translation of the Bible makes this point clear. Matthew 13:41 (NASB)\nThe Son of Man (God-Jesus) will send forth His angels, and they will gather OUT OF HIS KINGDOM (God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom) ALL STUMBLING BLOCKS (Those who cause others to fall, sin, block their relationship with God), and THOSE WHO COMMIT LAWLESSNESS. (Those who act, behave, and conduct themselves outside of the LAW OF LOVE)\n1) The weeds are described by Jesus as STUMBLING BLOCKS.\nStumbling blocks stop people from pursuing their journey. They slow people down. They cause them to fall. In this particular context the \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo; make it difficult for the \u0026ldquo;wheat\u0026rdquo; to grow. This is a great image of what God\u0026rsquo;s people face in the open field of a broken world. You may be weed in a marriage. Or someone may be weed in your life. Make no mistake. The devil and the weed will make sure you suffer, slow you down, and get you discouraged.\nThis very interesting prophetic aspect describes the very demonic nature of the \u0026ldquo;weeds.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Weeds\u0026rdquo; (people who are not walking with God) make the message of God hard to understand.\nWeeds are represented by the suffocating influence of RELIGION, the same way it was while Jesus was on this earth.\nWeeds complicate the perception of God. They \u0026ldquo;doctrinize,\u0026rdquo; they \u0026ldquo;dogmatize,\u0026rdquo; they \u0026ldquo;theologize,\u0026rdquo; God! They focus on the dark aspects of the unknown instead of offering hope for the present. They rather be right about a prophetic interpretation than to feed the homeless and the hungry. Their values are upside down.\nThe farm is supposed to be about life, abundant life. The wheat are organically living and growing to produce a good crop. Yet, the constant intent of he weed is to suck life from the same soil to kill.\nThe weeds, like cancer cells suck up the life of the body, to kill. They are ANTI-LIFE, but they need LIFE to pursue their ANTI-LIFE movement. :-) No description could be more accurate to describe the presence of demonic forces in the world and the spirit of the bad farmer who planted bad seeds in the middle of the night.\nSomeone said to me today talking about the book of Revelation, that many Christians read the book and become \u0026ldquo;beast-centered\u0026rdquo; instead of being \u0026ldquo;lamb-centered.\u0026rdquo; Great linguistic image! The beast is a defeated foe in the presence of the lamb, if you read the last page of the story.\nWhere people need love and compassion, the weeds plant fear and darkness. When someone speaks of love, compassion, taking care of the poor, the weeds see someone suspicious! \u0026ldquo;Wonder what this person is all about? Too simple. Only love and compassion? Anything deeper? More substance?\u0026rdquo;\nThe weeds long for charts, dark conspiracy theories, and date setting. Where hope is needed the \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo; crash it with fear. Where truth is called for, the \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo; edit videos and movies to scare people. The \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo; are malicious! Their agenda is to bring to a halt the growth of the wheat. They are set on bankrupting the good farmer and His family.\nWhatever you do, which discourages people from letting God love them, makes you a weed. The weeds are all about religion and low on relationships. Weeds twist and create a false image of God.\n2) The weeds, say Jesus, commit LAWLESSNESS.\nThe Greek word for \u0026quot;lawless\u0026rdquo; is \u0026quot;anomos\u0026rdquo; (a=without; nomos=law; and thus anomos means \u0026ldquo;without law or lawless\u0026rdquo;). In the New Testament this word is translated in different ways (\u0026ldquo;lawless,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;unlawful,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;wicked,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;transgressor\u0026rdquo;) but it always conveys the basic meaning of \u0026ldquo;lawless.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;lawless?\u0026rdquo; Let\u0026rsquo;s go deeper. \u0026ldquo;Lawlessness\u0026rdquo; is limited in its meaning to the context of the Biblical narrative. For you never have a total vacuum of laws. You either have \u0026ldquo;organizing laws,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;organic laws that enable life,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;purposeful laws,\u0026rdquo; or you have \u0026ldquo;destructive laws,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;chaotic laws, that kill life and wholeness.\u0026rdquo;\nYou see, Friend, this specific kind of \u0026ldquo;lawlessness\u0026rdquo; is the absence of God\u0026rsquo;s purposeful order, harmony, predictability, and relational wholeness.\nWhat would happen if the law of gravity would stop working? Can you imagine? The absence of such law would creates a vacuum for the law of anarchy, complete chaos, loss of living purpose. You get the idea!\nLet me use again the example of cancer. Cancer is simple a \u0026ldquo;wild cell that chooses to go organically lawless.\u0026rdquo; A cancer cell goes against the laws of life. But it needs \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo; to perpetrate its destructive activity. So it sucks the life of the body and reproduces. If successful, it will drain the life of the body and kill it by a law of destruction.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what the\u0026quot;weeds\u0026rdquo; of Jesus\u0026rsquo; parable are all about. When people talk about obeying the 10 commandments as the mark of God\u0026rsquo;s people I increasingly feel it\u0026rsquo;s such a \u0026ldquo;cheap,\u0026rdquo; anemic image of something which is much greater. \u0026ldquo;Weeds\u0026rdquo; live by different \u0026ldquo;laws.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026ldquo;wheat\u0026rdquo; grows by the law of purposeful life, which is to produce grain. The \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo; grow by laws that look similar to the wheat but their purpose is totally different. \u0026ldquo;Weeds\u0026rdquo; will entangle the roots of the wheat and kill them if they can.\n  First. The weeds are the seed of the devil in the farm of this world. They are all over the place mixed with the wheat. God is love. His law is RELATIONAL WHOLENESS OR LOVE. The devil is the anti-LOVE force of the universe. As love creates wholeness, the absence of love creates dualism, fragmentation, DIS-EASE, cancer, and brokenness. The weeds are living in open rebellion to the very foundation of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom. In the Bible that condition is also translated as \u0026ldquo;iniquity\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 13:41- KJV)\n  Here is my second thought. If the \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo; are \u0026ldquo;weeding\u0026rdquo; the field, they are disobeying God\u0026rsquo;s order, even though they may keep the 10 commandments. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that an interesting predicament for law abiding religious people? You are lawless according to the law of God\u0026rsquo;s life and love, if you are wedding the farm. You are on your own. You are operating by your own laws\u0026hellip;\n  The owner of the farm forbids YOU, ANY CHURCH, DENOMINATION OR RELIGIOUS GROUP TO PULL THE WEEDS! So the important question here is not: Who are the weeds? (Which is mostly what religion does), but how do you know if YOU are wheat or weed? History is full of examples of groups and sects that grew up to \u0026ldquo;clean up the field\u0026rdquo; and they failed. It\u0026rsquo;s not God\u0026rsquo;s purpose. Sometimes God allows a movement to be born for a purpose, for a time, to strengthen the wheat of the field, not to become \u0026ldquo;weed killers\u0026rdquo; by turning into a massive corporate organization.\nBy the way, the religious weed killing business, last I heard, was doing pretty well financially. People pay good money for \u0026ldquo;weed killing.\u0026rdquo; :-) You would amazed how profitable the business is. Weed killers feel good when they are busy cleaning the field. They become weed!\n Here is my third thought. If you are \u0026ldquo;LOVELESSLY\u0026rdquo; obeying the 10 commandments you may be \u0026ldquo;LAWLESS.\u0026rdquo; This comes as a shock to some.  The entire law of God is invalidated by the very absence of what the law is supposed to direct you into: LOVE. The law is a mirror of what matters to God, LOVE! The law is supposed to show you WHOM you need in your life to LIVE forever!\nPeople ask me all the time: \u0026ldquo;Is it possible to observe the 10 commandments and be lost?\u0026rdquo; Sad answer. Absolutely. Of course it possible! You can be \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; measured by the 10 commandments and still be lost.\nLOVE is what distinguishes the lawful activity of the wheat, and the lawless life of the \u0026ldquo;weed.\u0026rdquo;\nRemember 1 Corinthians 13: 1-3? You can do some pretty amazing things and be very unloving. You can be a moral RAMBO and yet be empty of love.\nRemember the \u0026ldquo;Rich Young Ruler\u0026rdquo; who came to Jesus? He kept the 10 commandments perfectly! Here was the perfect candidate to expand Jesus\u0026rsquo; ministry! The disciples were so shocked\u0026hellip; They said, \u0026ldquo;Jesus, how can this be? If this guy is lost\u0026hellip; who can make it?\u0026rdquo; They were still learning the basic lessons of law obedience,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;life relational wholeness\u0026rdquo; that only comes as a gift of God\u0026rsquo;s grace!\nThere was only one little thing missing in this powerful, wealthy guy\u0026rsquo;s religious \u0026ldquo;To Do List.\u0026rdquo; BE LOVING! He lost it all! (Luke 18:18-22)\n The fourth thing I want you to ask yourself in view of this parable is this: HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE WHEAT OR WEED?  1) Matthew 13:37, says, \u0026ldquo;The good seed, these are the sons [and daughters] of the Kingdom.\nThis is interesting. In the parable of the soil, the \u0026ldquo;seed\u0026rdquo; is the message of God. (Matthew 13). In this parable of the \u0026ldquo;wheat\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;weed,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;seed\u0026rdquo; is the very life of God planted in the soil. The DNA of these \u0026ldquo;seeds\u0026rdquo; is of divine nature. You have been born of God. You have been declared perfect by God since the times of eternity (Ephesians 1) and you have let God love you. God\u0026rsquo;s DNA is growing you. You belong to God\u0026rsquo;s family.\n2) The seeds of God are planted in the world. There is no safe nest or castle for \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo;. God is letting you and I know that we will be growing in the midst of \u0026ldquo;enemies.\u0026rdquo; It gets tough out there in the field. There is no safe ground just because you are \u0026ldquo;wheat.\u0026rdquo; Weeds abound and God does not encourage you to fight them, debate them or pull them off.\nThe most effective form of evangelism happens when you are planted in the world not in a pot by yourself or a bunch of Pharisaical seeds! The best mark of a Pharisees or a bunch of them is this: ISOLATION, and a drive to identify, mark, deprive of water, and pull if at all possible the WEEDS out of the farm.\n3) If the weeds, are stumbling blocks, make other people fall away from God, and block their relationship with the true God of love and grace, THE WHEAT WILL INSTEAD ATTRACT PEOPLE TO THE AUTHENTIC GOD!\nThe \u0026ldquo;wheat\u0026rdquo; are like magnets of life. I love the stories of Jesus. How He attracted people. The Samaritan woman. The wheat manifest love, compassion, empathy, they walk in the shoes of the broken. They bring the healing of God to the suffering and people who live in the margins of the culture. The wheat speak with the distinctive tone of the God who is a Shepherd.\nThe wheat are God\u0026rsquo;s TRUE CHURCH in the world. The wheat DON\u0026rsquo;T SPREAD FEAR, USE FEAR TO ATTRACT PEOPLE. Fear is not from God. (1 John 4;18) Condemnation is not from God (Romans 8:1)\nShame, condemnation, fear, legalism, rigid rules, an angry demanding God, dogmatism, and a judgmental spirit, are all functions of RELIGION, thus they belong in the category of weeds!\n4) If the \u0026ldquo;weeds\u0026rdquo; represents \u0026ldquo;lawlessness,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;WHEAT\u0026rdquo; REPRESENT THOSE WHO HAVE LET GOD LOVE THEM, AND THEY ARE ABLE TO RESPOND TO GOD IN LOVE, BY OBEYING HIS LAWS, BY LOVING PEOPLE.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s simple. Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;IF you LOVE ME, KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS, not the other way around! (John 14:15). Religion says, keep the commandments to show you love God! God cares about a relationship with you first.\nJohn 13:35 says, \u0026ldquo;In this, the world will know you are WHEAT, they will know you are MY TRUE CHURCH\u0026hellip;,IF you LOVE!\u0026rdquo; There is is a big IF again! The absence of love immediately reveals you are weed!\nTwo living organisms, the weed and the wheat, living by different laws: One grows to produce good crop, the other to produce nothing\u0026hellip; just make the life of the wheat as miserable as possible!\nIn the end false religion will not be about false doctrines but the ABSENCE OF LOVE (Mathew 24:12 - The Message)\nthe logic of forgiving, enduring, tolerating, LOVING the weeds and allowing them to grow alongside? That\u0026rsquo;s no logic at all.\nThis parable has profound implications as to how we approach the people who come to us. If I read this parable right, God calls us to proclaim His message of love, grace, transforming power to ALL alike. This parable reminds me I don\u0026rsquo;t know who is \u0026ldquo;wheat\u0026rdquo; and who is \u0026ldquo;weed.\u0026rdquo; I must be inclusive, welcoming, loving, compassionate, merciful, gentle to all people. In fact, as a Pastor I must make sure that \u0026ldquo;farmers\u0026rdquo; are not out there pulling \u0026ldquo;weeds.\u0026rdquo; Those \u0026ldquo;farmers\u0026rdquo; are the darkest secret of churches who consider themselves to be carriers of the \u0026ldquo;truth of God.\u0026rdquo; They are the modern Pharisees. They are the ones who want to stone the woman caught having sex. They judge the Zacheous of this world. They are quick to judge the woman who crawls under the table to anoint Jesus\u0026rsquo; feet with a mix of perfume and tear of gratefulness.\nLet the paradox sink in, for you are in the farm\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s only the foolishness of the cross that explains this upside down parable of Jesus.\n  There will be a large visible \u0026ldquo;church\u0026rdquo; or world religion that will desperately attempt to save the world, the planet by a mix of religion, technology, science and politics. It\u0026rsquo;s not hard to believe it, if you are watching the way things are rolling now.\n  There will be, I believe, a fragmented, invisible, perhaps underground church that will be persecuted for for resisting to worship a false system of salvation.\n  Do you trust the farmer (Jesus Christ) to keep you healthy, vibrant, alive in the midst of the weeds until the harvest time?\nA Warning About the Mark of the Beast # At some point, the Bible seems to predict that managed communism will take over the world, and God’s people are instructed not to conform, but that this will result in much fleshly tragedy.\nThe second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666. (Revelation 13:15-18) 1\nBeing obedient to God will mean the difficulty of not being able to buy and sell. Being able to buy and sell will mean the uncomfortable reality of being at odds with God, and the consequences of this choice. What is it about this mark for God to use such a strong warning?\nThe most obvious takeaway from this is, do not allow yourself to be physically marked and brought into any sort of slavery to mankind, such as a smartwatch or an embedded chip that monitors your activity and pays you for labor not even if it becomes required by law in cooperation with vaccination tracking. Even getting a vaccination, chip or signing your name to a false contract could be seen by God as giving ownership over to Satan. Your sole dependency should be on God! If you believe in Jesus, you have been bought by the Blood of Jesus and you should never give yourself over to anything that attempts to claim ownership over you. But this also applies to receiving a \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; in the spiritual realm, receiving a “mark” on the right hand (willful action) or forehead (mindset), or attending a false man-made religious system (such as worshiping the Earth for the sake of climate change). Do not cling to the world, religion or mankind\u0026rsquo;s systems of control, but instead cling to the kingdom of God and to the true King.\nThen I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to preach to the inhabitants of the earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people; and he said with a loud voice, “Fear God [with awe and reverence], and give Him glory [and honor and praise in worship], because the hour of His judgment has come; [with all your heart] worship Him who created the heaven and the earth, the sea and the springs of water.” (Revelation 14:6-7, Amp)\nWorship can also be obedience, allegiance, attention, even work. So, God takes who we give control/surrender and ownership over our life to very seriously. Only Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who is Lord and God is truly worthy of obedience, allegiance, praise, and affections!\nThe only safeguard against the mark of the beast is to have your name written in the Book of Life. To have our names written in the Book of Life is the greatest honor that can be given to mankind because it is the only way to enter Heaven, and Jesus washing away our sins is the only way to be written in the Book. Learning to walk with God starting now is very important. Practicing to trust in Him for the little as well as the big things of everyday life starting now will be critical. It will be impossible to suddenly trust God at the enforcement of the mark of the beast when one has neglected to do so before then. Time and trust have to be invested in your relationship with God as in any other important relationship in your life, the one with him being the most important. To make a stand for God, even in the face of severe hardship and possibly, death, will require an unshakable faith to endure to the end. Only by Christ\u0026rsquo;s help are we going to endure to the end. He will provide for us when we cannot provide for ourselves; He will fight for us when we cannot fight for ourselves and, He will deliver us when we cannot deliver ourselves. The following are promises that He will be with us no matter what is coming: [20] “\u0026hellip;I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen. Matthew 28:20.\nWe have been promised a life which seems impossible when we consider our unpleasant reality on this earth, but thankfully, “The things which seem impossible with men are possible with God.” Luke 18:27. “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” 1 Corinthians 2:9. What does God have in store for those who choose Him? No more death [4] And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. Revelation 21:4. [11] \u0026hellip;He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death. Revelation 2:11. [6] Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years. [14] Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Revelation 20:6, 14. Eternal life [11] And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.\n[12] He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. [13] These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God. 1 John 5:11-13. [23] \u0026hellip; the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23. [11] And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 1 John 5:11. [7] “\u0026hellip;To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.” Revelation 2:7.\nAre You Worshipping the Devil? # I know my question may sound outrageous. But one thing is clear, if you are not worshiping God you are worshiping the devil!\nWhat is worship?\nWorship is to declare the worthiness, the meritoriousness, and the recognition God ALONE deserves. Matthew 6:33, does not use the word worship but implies the heart of worship. \u0026ldquo;Seek FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all the other things shall be added unto you\u0026rdquo;\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t hear much about devil worship, demon possession and idolatry in the world of Christianity, because we fear the implications of the subject.\nIn Matthew 12:30, Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;You are either with me or against me.\u0026rdquo; There is no in-between in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. You are either walking with God as His follower, or you are walking away from Him, even if you are a religious person, do, and follow the \u0026ldquo;God stuff\u0026rdquo; in church and your personal life.\nEzekiel was an ancient prophet of God. He was in exile along with his people under the dominating power of the time, Babylon. The people were suffering under the harsh control of the King. God used Ezekiel in the midst of this catastrophe and arduous conditions to speak to His people. They were in captivity because they had become devil worshipers, demon driven, enemies of God! They had given themselves to raw, open idolatry! God spoke to Ezekiel in a series of seven visions during 22 years from 593 to 571 BC, a period which spans to the final destruction of Jerusalem in 586. The worst was still to come for the people of Israel: the final collapse and destruction of their beloved Jerusalem.\nHere is one of the messages God gave Ezekiel:\n\u0026ldquo;Son of man, these [people] have set up their IDOLS IN THEIR HEARTS, and put before them that which causes them to stumble into iniquity.\u0026rdquo;—Ezekiel 14:3\nThe message was clear. They had worshiped the devil, they set up idols in their hearts. As a result of it they became BLIND to the reality of God\u0026rsquo;s sovereign presence and power. They stumble into spiritual darkness and abhorrent behavior in the eyes of God. Iniquity is really a bad condition in the Bible. It means the lowest, the most repudiating, most challenging conduct against God\u0026rsquo;s will. Jesus used this word to describe people who will be lost forever, while believing that their religious, moral, ethical acts would save them. He called them \u0026ldquo;doers of iniquity.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 7: 23)\nI find it interesting that the first two of the Ten Commandments deal with the issue of other \u0026ldquo;gods.\u0026rdquo; The first commandment says, \u0026ldquo;You shall have no other gods before Me\u0026rdquo; (Exodus 20:3, 4), while the second commandment says, \u0026ldquo;You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any LIKENESS of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God\u0026rdquo;\nIdols in your heart can cause God to refuse to listen to your prayers. Did you know that, Friend? An idol is anything (or anyone) that takes the place of God in our lives. It also can be a seemingly good thing. Idolatry takes the place of God, in that it creates human \u0026ldquo;tangibility.\u0026rdquo; The need to touch, smell, sense, see, feel, create, be proud of, is so ingrained in the human nature. Faith is exactly the opposite of \u0026ldquo;tangibility.\u0026rdquo;\nFor example:\n  You can make an idol out of your career, education, or academic achievements. You can teach theology or be a pastor, and idolize your views, position and displace God, while talking about God. There is nothing wrong with a career, but if it is more important than God, then it has become an idol.\n  You can make an idol out of a relationship or out of a marriage, family, husband, wife, boyfriend, or girlfriend. Some people marry their idol. They are in love with their idol. They divorce because their \u0026ldquo;idol\u0026rdquo; failed and they look for the next \u0026ldquo;idol.\u0026rdquo; (Illusions of a better life, more love, no hassles).\n  You can make an idol out of money or material possessions. There is nothing wrong with money, but if money directs your moves, your connections, your life style, your image, your heart, then money has taken the place of God.\n  Anything that takes the place of God, is an idol. Once the idol is set in your heart, you will go blind, and you will be an open field for satanic and demonic possession. The idol can be good or bad: it simply needs to take the place of God. Gluttony, lack of self-control, food, alcohol, drugs, sex, pornography, addictions, occult practices, admiration of power, wealth, prosperity, sense of security, personal image, prestige, fame, role, religion, selfishness (Me, me, me), watching trashy movies, reading trashy books, empty entertainment, being busy all the time, and driven by the outside world. These are some of the idols that can grow roots deep in your heart. Take a look at Galatians 5 and read there what happens when demonic forces take over. (Read it in The Message if you have that version)\n  Here is my point, if you or me are worshiping the devil, growing, nurturing and protecting idols in our hearts, God will not hear our prayers. Does that make God a \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; God? Listen, Friend! Out of mercy, God will not hear or respond to prayers that will destroy you forever! Like the people of Israel, many times when we are up against the wall of circumstances, pain, and suffering, we open the door to God\u0026rsquo;s supremacy. Are you with me? He wants you to fall in love with Him, so you not only get what you want, but will find delight in His presence, and receive way more than you would get if God would be your puppet and give you what you want in a state contrary to God\u0026rsquo;s will!\nPsalm 37:4 says, **\u0026ldquo;DELIGHT yourself in [God] and He will give you the DESIRES of your heart.\u0026rdquo;**Phenomenal promise from God to His followers!\nWhatever is going on in your life, surrender to God. A bad marriage, a conflict with your children, a conflict with your boss, the grief for the loss of a loved one, a financial challenge, sickness, cancer\u0026hellip; Whatever! All undesirable human conditions, tend to drive us to create idols to satisfy our needs. God asks us to go in the opposite direction! There is nothing the devil wants more than to encourage you to satisfy your human needs your way! If he gets you there, there is no limit to his control in your life!\nSurrender your idols. Good and bad. Ask Him to free you from demonic drives and forces in your life. Ask God to give you peace and a sense of His presence in the midst of whatever storm you are facing right now. Surrender to God and you will witness wonders and miracles! Worship God and God alone. Ask Him to teach you which situations, relationships and behaviors are idols in your life. Give it all up for Him! You will be blessed beyond your wildest imagination! You will enjoy the most fun with God in your life! He is not a \u0026ldquo;fun killer.\u0026rdquo; He is instead the source of the greatest joy and happiness you have ever known!\nAliens are Demons # It’s clear that in the last days, there will be much confusion and deception about what is really fact, true and what is false. People will call good evil and evil good. There will be a false light, a righteousness that seems right but lacking in power. The Antichrist will produce lying signs and wonders, manifestations.\nSatan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. (2 Cor. 11:14)\nSpiritualism, New Age movements, humanism all have their roots in demonic deception of self-worship and self-love. The New Age movement is part of the coming New World Order and may become an official “state” religion. This call will be further strengthened by UFO activity, with a supposed contact with aliens, so that we can be merged with an intergalactic civilization. The New Age Movement is seeking to bring all religions together to homogenize religions across the world and prepare them to receive the One World Church (Globalization of Religion)\nIn the Book of Enoch it says that the leader of the fallen angels was called Azazel, and he is often identified with Lucifer (the Lightbringer) or Lumiel (‘the light of God’).\nThe Galactic Federation of Light is the big push of the New Age Movement. Their story, these supposed masters are here to help humanity ascend to the next level. The Galactic Federation of Light is a deception of the evil side, and a part of the grand delusion, they serve both sides.\nWith one accord the so called ‘aliens’ are calling for a false love, false peace. The so called ‘love’ they are calling for is natural human love based on evolution. This is the grand delusion that Satan and demons disguised as aliens are going to deceive the world with. The mind is the last frontier that man thinks he can conquer. To prove it, God will allow Satan to throw every supernatural power he has at man to deceive them, because they rejected the only way to the truth there was; the strait gate and narrow way. The grand delusion is designed in such a way as to prove to man that he is a \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo;. The fallen church will plunge headlong into this delusion, and in fact has already by and large embraced parts of it.\nThe only way to find freedom from the lies is to love the eternal Word of God and keep it in your heart. People, culture, society changes but God does not.\nNew Heaven and New Earth # When the final judgment has been completed following the 1,000-year peaceful reign of Jesus, the Bible says that God will roll up Earth and the heavens like a scroll, and a \u0026ldquo;new heaven and earth\u0026rdquo; will appear, with the \u0026ldquo;New Jerusalem\u0026rdquo; coming down out of heaven from God. God\u0026rsquo;s dwelling place will then be among His people on the new earth. His beautiful and eternal dwelling place is described in Revelation 21-22.\nThus will begin a whole new chapter in this story God is writing. We have no idea what happens next, but we can be assured that we will spend eternity with our savior, ruling and reigning with Him as he continues to create and do new things!\n"}).add({id:25,href:"/docs/book/next-steps/",title:"Now What?

Avoid the traps of intellectualism, selfishness (ego), religion (control), confusion. God wants you to walk with Him! Choose a personal experience with God which is LIFE.
