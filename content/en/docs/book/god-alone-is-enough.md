One of the biggest fears that people face is the fear of lack. It's the fear that your needs won't be met - that you'll run out of resources and that God won't come through for you in time.

You may be in a situation of lack that you've never been in before, in desperate need of finances or other resources to simply meet your basic needs. Maybe you're facing an emotional or spiritual lack. The spirit of fear might be attacking you, telling you that God cannot meet your needs and that you won't make it.

**You need to know today that the enemy is a liar,** and God cares about your situation. He has a plan and He is working on your behalf to provide what you need at the right time. Even when it seems like nothing is coming your way, God always knows how to miraculously provide.

Whatever your needs may be - financial, physical, emotional, spiritual - you don't have to fear lack. God will provide for you, comfort you, nourish you and bring you back to a place of strength. Trust in His provision.

And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19 (NLT)

"..the ones who seek the Lord will not lack any good thing." *(Psalm 24:10, MEV)*

We are all facing increasing complexity in this world of ours. Yet, the message of Jesus, reminds us that a simple life, lived in the presence of God is the only thing that really matters.

“Don’t hoard TREASURE down here where it gets eaten by moths and corroded by rust or—worse!—stolen by burglars. Stockpile treasure in heaven, where it’s safe from moth and rust and burglars. It’s obvious, isn’t it? The place where your treasure is, is the place you will most want to be, and end up being. Matthew 6:19-34 (The Message)

“Your eyes are windows into your body. If you open your eyes wide in wonder and belief, your body fills up with light. If you live squinty-eyed in greed and distrust, your body is a dank cellar. If you pull the blinds on your windows, what a dark life you will have! [Jesus is referring here to what gets your attention! What you focus on! YOUR MIND IS THE EYE, THE WINDOW, OF YOUR HEART-The center of your passion and emotions!]

“You can’t worship two gods at once. Loving one god, you’ll end up hating the other. Adoration of one feeds contempt for the other. YOU CAN’T WORSHIP GOD AND MONEY BOTH [A better translation for money is MATERIALISM, that which keeps you busy pursuing money, power, and the tangible rewards of a busy life.]

“IF YOU DECIDE FOR GOD,…it follows that you don’t fuss about what’s on the table at mealtimes or whether the clothes in your closet are in fashion. There is far more to your life than the food you put in your stomach, more to your outer appearance than the clothes you hang on your body.

Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.

“Has anyone by fussing in front of the mirror ever gotten taller by so much as an inch? All this time and money wasted on fashion—do you think it makes that much difference? Instead of looking at the fashions, walk out into the fields and look at the wildflowers. They never primp or shop, but have you ever seen color and design quite like it? The ten best-dressed men and women in the country look shabby alongside them.

“If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers—most of which are never even seen—don’t you think he’ll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you?

What I’m trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with GETTING, so you can RESPOND TO GOD’S GIVING.

Don’t worry about missing out. You’ll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.

“Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don’t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. GOD WILL HELP YOU DEAL WITH WHATEVER HARD THINGS COME UP WHEN THE TIMES COMES.

The most **EMPOWERING** presence for every **POSITIVE CHOICE** you make is God! Read these promises. Every time you make a **POSITIVE CHOICE** God is next to you, ready to assist you!

**For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.** *(2 Timothy 1:7, NLT)*

**I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation…I can do all this through him who gives me strength.** *(Philippians 4:12-13 NIV)*.

**God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.** *(Psalm 46:1, NIV)*
