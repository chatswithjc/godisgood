When Jesus was crucified, it was an enormous shock to His followers. They secretly expected Him to establish His kingdom on earth when pushed against the wall! They saw how Jesus was mistreated. To the last moment, they waited for a divine manifestation of power to take care of Jesus, and prove to the world He was indeed the Messiah, the liberator of the Jewish nation. They figured out that if Jesus was able to heal the sick, provide food to crowds out of nothing, wine out of water, He could also perform a miracle in His behalf! But instead, He was beaten, spit on, ridiculed, and hung on a Roman cross. They heard with their own ears Jesus' words, “It is finished.” Then they watched Him die before their very eyes. They went back home on that Friday evening thinking it was OVER! It was good as it lasted.

The power of God is manifested upon those who BELIEVE. Doubt is deadly to your relationship with God. **Believing begins with gratefulness.** You will never believe God with all your heart if you are not grateful for what He is doing in your life, now. It’s your attitude, not your aptitude, that will give you altitude. Gratefulness is a transforming attitude. Why would you believe in God, if you feel negative about your life? If you don’t see anything to be grateful for? Believing is rooted in gratefulness. Perhaps, you need to ask God to change your eyes, your mind, to see how He is blessing you in the midst of adverse circumstances. Gratitude is a spiritual powerful habit. From gratitude you will move to joy, to worship, to adoration… and TO BELIEVING in the power and the love of God.
