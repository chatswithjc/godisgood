Regardless of your age at this moment, God has been watching you since the day you were born. God has been allowing things to happen or not to happen. There is no room for arrogance in God’s universe. Yes, you made choices, but your choices were enabled because God let it happen! When God chooses to override your freedom of choice, you are DONE, Friend! God is the supreme manager of the entire universe.

There is only one thing I hang on to: and that is the fact that every thing that happens to you as a follower of God, in this life, God promises to use to shape you for eternity! That’s it! I can hold on to this in the midst of darkness. I can hold on to this, when people tell me horrible stories of their past life. People share with me dark secrets of their past. Abuse suffered… They show me the scars on their walls of their hearts. Disillusionment. Shattered dreams. Hopes that will never crystallize in reality. Lives cut short by a tragic accident, cancer or drug overdose. Why? Why? You, see… I don’t know!

“Before I shaped you in the womb, I KNEW ALL ABOUT YOU. Before you saw the light of day, I had HOLY PLANS FOR YOU” *(Jeremiah 1:5)*

“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart." *(Jeremiah 29:11-13)*

No one, on the face of the planet, loves you more than God. No one longs to bless you more than God. Did you know that?

It begins with a PROMISE. “I have plans for you.” God always initiate the process of loving. That’s the difference between RELIGION and a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. Religion reminds you of what you need to do to reach up to God. A relationship with God reminds of what He has already done for you. You must respond to His love!

Then comes YOUR CHOICE. “You will seek me and find me.” He never forces us. We seek Him by choice. And He promises us we will find Him.

But, you see, nothing from God is granted to you, to simply enjoy a good life. Every gift from God has a purpose! He calls you to share His blessings with the world.

The closer you walk with God, the more you will feel His heartbeat, the more you will begin to see how EVERYTHING is connected even if at the moment it feels intolerable! The tapestry of your life is one that includes your choices, your rejections, your unexpected serendipitous events, other people’s decisions, and God’s intervention and supervision above all things! Nothing escapes God’s vigilant eye.

You may not be aware, just now, of the reasons why things happened to you, but the more you cling to God in your personal relationship with Him, the more you will see the connections. And here is the key, you will only understand and trust that God is in control of every detail of your life, as you surrender to Him… As you learn to walk with Him. He will open your eyes... He will give you supernatural wisdom and you will be amazed at God’s grace and magnificent attention to the details of your life!

“He knows us far better than we know ourselves, knows our pregnant condition, and KEEP US PRESENT BEFORE GOD. That’s why we can be SO SURE THAT EVERY DETAIL in our lives of love for God [Relationship with God] is WORKED into something GOOD." *(Romans 8:28)*

“You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good” *(Gen. 50:20)*.

Do you believe that when you surrender to God, He can use your past, your hurts, your wounds, your enemies, your experiences for your own and others good? Do you believe God is managing your for a special purpose? Nothing is an accident, when you give God the control of your life...

This is what I know. God is more than a rational, intellectual reality you can grab like a text book, to understand. He is a RELATIONAL God. You can only catch glimpses of Him in a personal relationship with Him. You catch glimpses of God when you read the Bible, when you pray, when He whispers in your mind. What your relationship with God can not satisfy, your mind will never comprehend! Followers of God in word, without a relationship with Him, are a contradiction in terms. That’s why I often say, it’s easier to become a religious Christian and repeat the lingo, than it is to walk with God, read the Bible, contemplate God, meditate, reflect, and pray for enlightenment! Without a relationship, you do not have depth to grasp the reality of God.

“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live]." *(Ephesians 2:10)*
