What is the Gospel?? I don’t think most people really know.


* People are not going to fully appreciate the **good news** until they first know the **bad news.** The bad news is that we have **ALL** have sinned against God and have fallen short of His standards. **Good and bad people alike!** Our nature is fragmented. Our condition, just by breathing on this planet and having our parents genes, is **SINFUL.** Good people need God to be really good, as much as bad people do! And if we don't surrender to God, we will find ourselves, the good and the bad in us, fighting against God! (Romans 7-8; Galatians 5)

* People are not going to fully appreciate the **good news** until they experience **freedom,** inner healing, and the ability to share joy and wholeness with others. That was the problem with the Pharisees in the time of Jesus. They did not intentionally made difficult for people to walk with God! It started as a **"LET'S HELP YOU FIND THE STEPS TO WALK WITH GOD!"** And by the time they were done they had created an impossible system to follow! That's the trap, Friend! The **BIG TEN** of the law of God, broken down in **"HOW TOs"** became burdensome, and the **good news** were no longer good! Jesus came to show us the way. God's way makes you free, indeed!

If we will be faithful to the spirit of the gospel, we should always allow the Spirit of God TO BUILD A BRIDGE, BETWEEN THE HERE AND NOW, AND THE LOVE OF GOD THAT DOESN’T' WANT ANYONE TO PERISH! (2 Peter 3:9). The pulsating core of the Good News is that God reaches out to us, FIRST, (1 John 4:9) and then He finishes the work of perfection in our lives! (Philippians 1: 6). Your only role in this whole process is to make a choice: “Yes” or “No."

“Then you will know the TRUTH and the TRUTH will set you free!” And the truth is not a dogma, it’s not a theological statement, it is not a set of beliefs! The question is not WHAT but WHO is the truth. In the Bible TRUTH is always relational and the end result is always freedom!; not religious and legalistic slavery and fear! Jesus said, “I am the TRUTH” (John 14:6) God is the TRUTH. The only way to know the truth is by RELATING to Him.

The true Gospel of God, will always be **GOOD NEWS.** And the **GOOD NEWS** will always be about **freedom!**

Do not accept any other Gospel! Be suspicious of a Gospel which feels like a heavy brick on your shoulders. Take a second look at a Gospel that drives you by fear! If the **TRUTH** does not free you, it is not the truth of God! Notice, I never said, there would be no difficulties in accepting the **Gospel of God's freedom.** We are conditioned by culture and religion to no believe it, or experience it!

Walking in the world, believing the true gospel of God.... Believing that God has freed you from sin **forever,** is the toughest challenge ever!
