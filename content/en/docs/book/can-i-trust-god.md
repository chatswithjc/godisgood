## Can the Bible be Trusted?

## What is the Bible all about?

> Jesus said, "You are busy analyzing the Scriptures, poring over them hoping to gain eternal life. Everything you read points to me" *(John 5:39, TPT)* The Bible is a love story from God. It contains the words of God, a story about humanity's struggle and God's love.
