## Can the Bible be Trusted?

The scriptures are full of amazing stories of God's work through history and is very honest about humanity. If you are having trouble trusting God or the scriptures, ask God for help - but you must really want help and be willing to let God speak to you. Start reading the Gospel of John. It's ok if you don't understand everything, just ask God for help.

> **"For an answer Jesus called over a child, whom he stood in the middle of the room, and said, "I'm telling you, once and for all, that unless you return to square one and start over like children, you're not even going to get a look at the kingdom, let alone get in. Whoever becomes SIMPLE and ELEMENTAL again, like this child, will rank high in God's kingdom. What's more, when you receive the childlike on my account, it's the same as receiving me."** *(Matthew 18:2-5 The Message)*

To really get results from the word of God, we have learn to unlearn all the lies and negativity we have accumulated as adults in a fallen world. God's invitation for those seeking Him is to just be like a child again. What is it like to be child-like?

* Focused on the future
* Forgives easily
* Loves simple
* No baggage
* Ask questions to figure out answers, not the other way around... :-)
* His worldview is uncomplicated
* Trusts easily
* Fearless
* Expresses emotions easily
* Doesn't rationalize or analyze emotions
* Befriends people easily
* Is not vengeful
* Doesn't rejoice in the failure or the pain of another child
* Doesn't gossip about others
* Doesn't try to exercise authority or control

Don't you think our world would be a better one if we could be more child-like? What would happen to your relationships is you simply love? If you simply trust? If you simply venture? If we approach God with the same honesty, at His terms not our own, we can get the results He promises. Most people only get to this point when they are desperate, why not give God a chance now?

**1) Embrace the moment.** Embrace your condition. Nothing is above or beyond God's control and power. There are no accidents in God's universe!

**2) Turn to God and place your situation before Him.** Surrender to Him. Give your condition to God. Cried out to God. Pray to Him. It doesn't matter if someone else caused it, your own imperfection, or life's conditions... **Go to God! Give it to Him! Give up. Don't fight!**

**3) Trust God.** He always takes the side of the helpless. When you are at the end of your robe, God will come through for you and for me (Matthew 5:1-12).

## What is the Bible all about?

> Jesus said, "You are busy analyzing the Scriptures, poring over them hoping to gain eternal life. Everything you read points to me" *(John 5:39, TPT)* The Bible is a love story from God. It contains the words of God, a story about humanity's struggle and God's love.

Once you put your trust in God's words, the Holy Spirit will help make the words come alive! You'll get a sense of direction, satisfaction, power because God's word is always speaking and giving hope, life!

**You will find that the greatest posessions aren't things but God Himself! Once you have God's promises in your life, there is no greater treasure**

**The miracle of a life in God is being joyous in the troubles of life, not the troubles of life just being taken away when I nurture my dreams and fantasies!**

Yes, God does take away some troubles, but there are other troubles that seem to stay. The one constant you can count on, is that **GOD IS ALWAYS THERE, ready to give you JOY in the midst of those troubles.**

So, next time you find yourself nurturing your dreams of a better life... or a life without that dark incident that caused so much pain... Or the loss of a loved one... Look up to God, and get the **JOY** of His presence... You will find your deepest needs met! That's why **FAITH** is so contrary to what religion, the culture and society teaches us. **MATERIALISM and RELIGION** say, "dream, dream, work hard, run away from pain, rush to the comfort zone, pray hard, be good and you will be rewarded, touch, experience, feel, get what you want... experience what you want..." So with that picture in mind we feel disappointed when things don't happen... we leave behind the people that need us the most... we abandon the paths that can teach us wisdom... we spend our life and energy pursuing what will not last... we walk away from the experiences God has for us... we seek instead the "pleasure" of pursuing our dreams...

> **FAITH and TRUST in God** catapult us to a higher dimension of spiritual consciousness, where we begin to understand that God is not "Santa Claus" or the "Cosmic provider of our capricious dreams," but the everlasting PRESENCE! Why do you want "things" when you can have Him?

Can you hear the word of Jesus in Gethsemane? This was the Jesus that walked to the edge of human disappointment when He said, "Father... Father... Why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46) And the silence of the Father, was Jesus path of faith and trust in God's everlasting plan for all eternity, and the entire human race! He never succumbed to the darkness of the hour!
