We live in uncertain financial times. Finances tend to create anxiety and stress. The one who has, wants to make sure, that what he has will last or increase. If you listen carefully to what is NOT being said in the world of politics, at the end of the day, it is all about economics. If you have money, in most cases you have POWER, and power moves the human world in which we live. Money buys positions, fame, reputation, compromise, excuses and even cheap love.

1 Timothy 6: 6-10 in The Message describes it the best. "**A devout life does bring wealth, but it's the RICH SIMPLICITY of being yourself before God.** Since we entered the world penniless and will leave it penniless, if we have bread on the table and shoes on our feet, that's enough.

But if it's only money these leaders are after, they'll self-destruct in no time. **Lust for money brings trouble and nothing but trouble.** Going down that path, some lose their footing in the faith completely and live to regret it bitterly ever after."

When was the last time you heard some of the "money" gurus, or prosperity management principles, describe so clearly what true wealth is?

Even in times of financial uncertainty, it’s always important to keep things in perspective.

**"Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.**

What I'm trying to do here is to **get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with GETTING, so you can respond to God's GIVING. People who** don't know God **and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions.** Don't worry about missing out. You'll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.

Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. **God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes."**

Ask God to show you today, how to live a simple life, enjoying what you have while LOVING people. **LOVE** is ultimately all we leave behind when our days on this earth come to an end.

### Contentment

**"I’ve LEARNED by now to be quite CONTENT whatever my circumstances. I’m just as happy with little as with much, with much as with little. I’ve found the recipe for being happy whether full or hungry, hands full or hands empty. Whatever I have, wherever I am, I can make it through anything in the One who makes me who I am."** Philippians 4: 11 (The Message)

For Paul to write that he was content in every situation is truly amazing. At the time of this writing, **he was in jail** in Rome. Charged with sedition, treason, and other serious crimes, he had appealed to the highest court: Caesar himself. Without other legal recourse and friends in high places, he had to wait for his case to be heard. It seems as if Paul had the right to be an impatient and unhappy person. Instead, he wrote to the Philippians to say that he had **LEARNED** to be content.

Contentment is not natural for any of us. The competitive spirit in us drives us to compare, to complain, to covet, and to seek vengeance. Few of us are in a predicament such as Paul’s, but we all face difficulties in which we can learn to trust God and be content.

The art of contentment is finally learned when we catch the fact that God is the fulfillment to all of our needs. It doesn't matter what it is. You can go to God and talk to him about what hurts you, bothers you, inconveniences you. He will hear you and fulfill the deepest needs of your heart. It's a choice. One time, many times, until you **LEARN** that God is all you need!
