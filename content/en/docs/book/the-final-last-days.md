You are experiencing the final days of "last days" of this age. Jesus is coming back in the flesh very soon! The Bible gave us a lot of clues about when the end of this age will come, and those signs are all around us! This is very exciting! However, we must wake up

For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. ‘Immediately after the distress of those days ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.  Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. (Matthew 24:27-34)

**There are 4 kids of responses to the "time of the end."**

**1) People who deny and refuse to get involved in prophecies regarding the "time of the end." This is the majority of the world. All 5 largest world religions refuse to deal with "time of the end" because of its complication, fear elements, and in credible diversity.** In live in earthquake land here in Southern California. Yet, the majority of people live like nothing will ever happen, and if the subject gets too serious, they walk away. That's the same response to anything catastrophic predicted in the future. Why do you think Noah preached 120 years, and **NO ONE** except his family were saved? Same today. (Mathew 24:37)

**2) People who obsess over "time of the end" prophecies, theories of interpretation, charts, conspiracy theories, esoteric information, date setting, and predictions.** Very often behind this drive there is an obsession for tangibility, **idolatrous knowledge,** and let's face it an intense lust for results. **Fear** creates results, followers, and **money.** People pay for pleasure and fear.

**3) Denominations, cults, and groups who use "time of the end" information to elevate themselves and define WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG. This approach creates a "we versus the rest" mindset that is also very reassuring. Group mind is very powerful.**

**4) Those honestly accept the main prophetic pillars that point to the "time of the end," but do not obsess over details.** How do you know when you are stepping into a territory not blessed by God? Simple. When 27 other "time of the end" experts are fighting regarding details and they all disagree on the details.

Seek to understand and believe the signs of the times as presented in the Bible. Do not obsessed over details because I promise you, for every detail you believe, someone else will come and tell you, you are wrong!

## Satan's Final Last Days Deception

Your BRAIN, your MIND is the territory the devil seeks; control of the physical just follows the control of your BRAIN.

Look at 2 Corinthians 4:4.

What part of your SELF does the devil blind? Its not the physical eyes, **HE IS AFTER YOUR BRAIN, your MIND!** He wants to slowly align those 100 billion neurons to work efficiently for him, until he gets total possession. The Greek word for mind is "_novhma Noema_", which translates **mental thought or perception, that which thinks.** Here is where Satan fights for control. All for the purpose of blinding you from the truth of God. He uses a variety of tools, strategies, skills to win the battle of your brain.

How you THINK, the inner-person YOU are, guides your perceptions. Here is where Satan is at work, and here is where the Bible warns us to set our guard. God’s word implores with you to protect YOUR BRAIN against the ways of this world, which are demonic in nature.

Satan and his fallen-angels, through the proxy of fallen-humanity, battle for the control of YOUR BRAIN. When a person surrenders to God, their perceptions change, because the Spirit of God, the presence of God, the Holy Spirit is now GUIDING THE BRAIN, THE THOUGHTS, THE MIND, THE WILL in a different direction. Satan looses total control over their mind. The kingdom of God has advanced on his territory.

**"The heart is hopelessly dark and deceitful, a puzzle that NO ONE can figure out.**

**But I, God, search the heart and examine the mind. I get to the heart of the human. I get to the root of things. I treat them as they really are, not as they pretend to be."**

You see, Friend, while religion, morality and culture define what's "right" and "wrong", God always goes deeper! The world says, "Do what your heart tells you. Follow your heart." That is a creed believed by millions today. It is one of the great cultural myths of the Western world, a gospel proclaimed in many movies and songs and television programs and stories. People spend hours watching movies that promote one of the devil's most accepted myths! Not only that, what they wouldn't dare do openly, because of the judgmental legalism and morality they would face, they live, accept, and caress in the depths of their hearts. Thus, their walk with God is incongruent! They follow religion, but in their fantasy world, they follow the devil! God says, "Your heart is deceitful." Even, when it looks like you are obeying the 10 commandments, and have the truth, and follow the truth, and do the religious stuff. (Rich Young Ruler Mark 10:17-27) Under all of that, there is a deeper reality. The condition of your heart is what God looks at! Your heart matters to God, more than your outward behavior! Your heart must be filled by God's presence, and His drive, to do His will, then your behavior will reflect it! I don't believe in judging externals. It is deceiving. Religion does that all the time. Whether it's adultery, homosexuality, abortion or whatever! Externals are always deceiving. When a person surrenders to God, and accepts Him in his/her heart, God changes people from the inside out. There is peace. There is harmony. The fruit of the Spirit blossoms fully. Galatians 5 (The Message) We need a higher standard of authority than our heart, our feelings, our emotions. A higher standard of authority than mere opinion from the culture, from morality, legalism, and religion. We must ask God to seek the depths of our hearts. That takes time. It takes a walk with God. It takes listening to God. It takes a commitment to reading God's Word in its totality. It takes prayer. And above all things it takes a humble heart! The problem we have today is a watered-down gospel. Religion has replaced the radical call of Jesus to look deep into our hearts. That's why religion is so quick to judge some sins such as adultery, **and very, very, very slow to call on the deeper sins of the heart: namely, pride, greed, materialism, money obsession, and insensitivity towards poverty, and injustice.** Because of that, many have a watered-down understanding of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, a follower of God. We have Christians who have become so much like the world, that the world doesn't even want to become like them. Remember Peter? And this is the truth! Have you ever watched Christians in "worldly" circles trying to "fit" and be "cool."? Here is the truth, Friend. What was considered normal followship of Christ in the first and the second century, before Christianity became an institution, would be considered **RADICAL** by today's standards. But that is what we need today: **RADICAL FOLLOWERS OF GOD.** To put it another way, we need followers of God that are willing to stand for God no matter what. We need followers of God that know that the only real **TRUTH** is the one God reveals in the heart! God transforms the human heart. The human heart without God is deceiving. I see all day long the results of behavior caused by the human heart. Give God a chance, Friend! Instead of trying to accommodate the Word of God to our changing culture, we need to accommodate our culture to the unchanging Word of God.
