**"Suppose one of you had a hundred sheep and lost one. Wouldn't you leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until you found it? When found, you can be sure you would put it across your shoulders, rejoicing, and when you got home call in your friends and neighbors, saying, 'Celebrate with me! I've found my lost sheep!' Count on itâ€”THERE'S MORE JOY IN HEAVEN OVER ONE SINNER'S RESCUED LIFE THAN OVER NINETY-NINE GOOD PEOPLE IN NO NEED OF RESCUE."** Luke 15:7 - The Message

Now... Who are the **"good people in no need of rescue"?**

Sometimes people wonder whether those in heaven or in other planets, know what is taking place on earth. Some would say no. But I beg to differ. I think heaven and God's creatures in other planets that have not sinned are aware of what is happening on earth.

However, I don't think our loved ones are sitting in heaven, watching everything we do. But I do believe the angels and inhabitants of "unfallen" planets know what is going on, and there are verses that I could cite to prove that point. (Revelation 5: 13, 14) **But this much I know CLEARLY: When someone surrenders to God and they repent of their sinful condition, there is REJOICING in heaven. Whenever there is a CONVERSION on earth, there is PARTYING in heaven. That, I know without a doubt!**

God gets excited when **LOST PEOPLE** accept Him and repent of their **LIFE WITHOUT GOD,** and so should we. As C. S. Lewis said, **Joy is the serious business of heaven.** So if they are having a party in heaven over the conversion of one person, should we, too, not be excited when we see someone come to Christ?

I believe that is what kept Jesus going, even to the cross, when He was on this earth! Hebrews 12:2 tells us that Jesus, "for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God." What was that joy? It was us. We were the joy. We were the prize. We were the treasure. We were the goal He went after and laid it all down for.

I want to leave a thought with you...

Could it be that we find it difficult to rejoice over a **lost person** coming to God because we really don't know what it means to be **lost**? Could it be that religion and culture have confused us so badly that we don't understand that **"NICE"** people, **"MORAL"** people, **"COMMANDMENTS OBEYING"** people,**"HELPFUL"** people, people with a **"GOOD HEART"** may be as lost throughout eternity as what we label **"BAD PEOPLE"?**

Being spiritually lost, doesn't mean being a horrible person, or a horrible sinner, committing horrible crimes, serious offenses, or a serial killer! **SPIRITUALLY LOST means being OK without God!** It means being OK with religion! It means God is not at the center of your life! It means God is not a relationship that is renewing you every day! It means you fulfill a religious duty once a week, or even daily, but God is not the driving force of your life! And, perhaps, you couldn't tell the difference between your good life and a life with God or a life without God! Isn't that tragic?

What matters most to God, Friend, is your relationship with Him. What matters most to God about your wife, your husband, your children, your friends, your co-workers, people in the community, is their relationship with God. Eternity is on the balance! And you are God's messenger to them! If you don't know the difference between being saved and being lost, you probably can not see the difference in others either!
