But as many as received Him (Jesus) to them, He gave the right to become God’s children,  to those who believe in Him (John 1:12). 

So then when we come to God by faith and acknowledge our sins (our disobedience, our going our own way instead of His way), He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins, and not only that but to cleanse us of all unrighteousness. He transforms our spirits into new creatures, and we immediately enter into His eternal life as we submit to His holy presence.

The knowledge that God offers His love to you every hour of every day may not be new to you; what may be new is that you have to receive Him who is love or His loving forgiveness will not become yours. Generally, humanity gives and receives human love. That is because most people have not received God’s love. We cannot give something we do not have. It is vital in all of our lives that we receive God’s love so that we can love Him back and love those around us with His love. The essence of salvation is receiving God’s forgiveness, which is part of His love. So we begin by receiving His love. If we are born again, we have already received His loving forgiveness. At any time, we can open the door and ask Him to come in, even right now, you can simply tell Him that you want to know Him personally and live with Him forever, that you want to love and obey Him, that you know that Jesus paid the penalty for your sin on the cross and now offers you His loving forgiveness. Then out of simple faith in what God has said, open the door and receive Him. Receive His love, His forgiveness and the fullness of His Holy Spirit.

In order to be saved, we must have genuine faith. Faith is complete trust in something we can’t see but are certain of it because we believe it is true. Faith is not feelings or positive thinking. Faith is a gift from God.

Now faith is the certainty of things hoped for, a proof of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)

And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6)

The word “grace” means something which is given freely...without cost or obligation. You cannot purchase eternal life with good works, right living. Remember, God will offer it only as a gift to you if you truly want it! When man attempts to gain eternal life through his own works, he is no longer accepting God’s offer of eternal life as a free gift, that is, by Grace.

**Wow is about having one's mind blown away by the fascinating reality of the unexpected... The small things...**

**God's grace is His infinite ability, driven by love, to SURVIVE my choices, my stupidity, my limitations, and suffer innocently as God, like I suffer innocently my sinful nature...** That was truly a "wow" moment!

If you will humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, in His good time, He will lift you up (1 Peter 5:6)

Know that humility is also necessary to receive God’s love, to be lifted up by our heavenly Father. We must put aside the love and concern we have for ourselves to make room for the love of another. God’s love is all around us all the time. If we make room, He will surely come in. You may ask, “How can I control this ego of mine and humble myself so that I can receive God’s love?” Our ego doesn’t want to be dependent on anyone; it wants others to be dependent on us, so that we appear to be someone special. But there is only One who is not dependent on anyone and that is God. It is said that a humble person does not stoop smaller than he is; he stands at his real height seeing the reality of how small he is compared to God. When he humbles himself, he does not have to put on an act anymore because he has the real thing. 

Humility causes us to begin to fit into God’s kingdom and into the purpose He has for our lives which is fellowship with Himself. In trusting humility, we can open the door of our hearts and receive God’s love through a real, personal, loving relationship (Revelation 3:20). Then, through the power of His love, we have the strength to overcome our old sinful nature and love Him back. Because He loves us first, we are able to do our part and complete an exchange of love.

"So here’s what I want you to do...: **Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering."** (as act of worship)

Live your ordinary life as a **Divine WOW** because you are keenly aware of God's presence in your collective consciousness and world around. In fact later on Paul makes a distinction between a dull, flat life lived according to the culture and the **"WOW"** experience God enables in your life from within. You simply respond to the amazing love and grace of God.
