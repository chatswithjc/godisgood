## Don't Just Do Nothing, Do Something!

> Peter replied, â€œRepent and return to God, and each one of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to have your sins removed. Then you may take hold of the gift of the Holy Spirit. (Acts 2:38 TPT)

* Let go and turn to God
* Make a public statement about your faith: tell others, get baptized in Jesus' name.
* Receive God's gift - the Holy Spirit, Love, Forgiveness - your sins are removed - trust God!

## Change Your Mind

Read God's Word - develop new, healthy thoughts

### Trust Jesus Christ

### Think Differently Religion About Sin

God is simple - you don't have to work hard to be good - God has made a way for you to be good enough through the baptism, death, burial, resurrection of Jesus Christ. Trust Jesus!

## The Most Important Thing: The Love of God!

> Because lawlessness is increased, the love of most people will grow cold. *(Matthew 24:12, AMP)*

In the end times there will be:
* Confusion (stupidity)
* Selfishness, greed
* False religion (ego, price, celebrites, dogma). (Religion is the worst drug)

Satan will try to ruin lives with pain, suffering, love of pleasure (hedonism), religion but all you really need in the end times is God's love and go forth love others. Avoid the traps of intellectualism, selfishness (ego), religion (control), confusion. God wants you to walk with Him! Choose a personal experience with God which is LIFE. Let God love you, Let God speak to you. God cannot be solid, He must be caught while seeking Him in the consciousness!
