## Why I Wrote God is Good

The "God is Good" Book was a dream conceived around 2010 by Harold J. Duarte-Bernhardt who was a Senior Pastor of "Life Center" in Hollywood, CA.  “Life Center” is not a denomination, it’s not a religion, it’s simply a movement rooted in John 10:10. “I have come," said Jesus, “that you may have LIFE and have it more abundantly!" Extravagant LIFE, in the frame of a magnificent God who wants to bless His followers. Extravagant in GRACE, mercy, forgiveness, LOVE, and POWER to transform, and intervene in your life at critical moments. (Isaiah 44, The Message, is the promise from God)

We believe our mission is introduce people to the GOOD NEWS of God’s Kingdom and encourage them to LET GOD LOVE THEM. We don’t get involved in religious debates. We believe there are enough churches to fulfill that role.

My hope with this book is that you give God another chance. Whether you don't think God is real, or can be known or if religious has let you down, it's never too late to give God a try.

## Who is this book for?

This eBook is for everyone because God invites everyone to the Kingdom. Jesus Christ is the answer for every problem!

## TL;DR (Too Long Didn't Read)

* Grace: You are enough. God is enough.
* LET GOD LOVE YOU, LIVE LOVED, LEARN TO LOVE GOD by seeking what matters to God on this earth (Kingdom) and consider God's way of doing things (righteousness). "Seeking the Kingdom of God" is not a religious act. It's a RELATIONAL enterprise. It's an attitude of vulnerability. No religion can teach you that.

**LOVE is ENOUGH...GRACE is ENOUGH...YOU" are ENOUGH...Because God IS ENOUGH!**

**Let God Love You! Live Loved. The Best is Yet to Come. Never Give Up.**

> “This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn’t go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. Anyone who trusts in him is acquitted; anyone who refuses to trust him has long since been under the death sentence without knowing it. And why? Because of that person’s failure to believe in the one-of-a-kind Son of God when introduced to him. (John 3:16-18, The Message)

## Please Share This Message

Once you choose to accept His blessing, He then calls YOU to GO OUT and tell others of the wonderful Kingdom News. This is the test of your gratefulness! If you are passionate about the God who loves you, you will be equally passionate about sharing such blessing with others. May I invite to consider your risk taking adventure. Will people walk into the Kingdom of God because of you? Will you impact someone's life with a more positive view of relationships?

My prayer is that you will choose this moment to follow Him no matter what! Do not be afraid! Only trust Him no matter what! Amen

## Further Resources for Your Growth

Religion is cold, performance driven, information-based works-based. 

> Jesus Christ absolutely did not come to this earth to establish another religion! He came to **re-establish God's relationship with you**. Jesus came preaching "The Kingdom of Heaven”; not "the church”. The Kingdom of God is inside of your heart where God longs to dwell if you accept Him.

**To grow in your faith, it's more important that you spend time with Jesus in prayer, fasting, reading the Bible than being busy going to church or doing random acts of kindness all the time. Showing compassion in goood works is a result of personal intimacy with Jesus.**
