## Why I wrote it


## My Story


## Who is this book for?


## TL;DR (Too Long Didn't Read)

* Grace: You are enough. God is enough.
* LET GOD LOVE YOU, LIVE LOVED, LEARN TO LOVE GOD by seeking what matters to God on this earth (Kingdom) and consider God's way of doing things (righteousness). "Seeking the Kingdom of God" is not a religious act. It's a RELATIONAL enterprise. It's an attitude of vulnerability. No religion can teach you that.

## Share This Message

Once you choose to accept His blessing, He then calls YOU to GO OUT and tell others of the wonderful Kingdom News. This is the test of your gratefulness! If you are passionate about the God who loves you, you will be equally passionate about sharing such blessing with others. May I invite to consider your risk taking adventure. Will people walk into the Kingdom of God because of you? Will you impact someone's life with a more positive view of relationships?

My prayer is that you will choose this moment to follow Him no matter what! Do not be afraid! Only trust Him no matter what! Amen

**"LOVE" is ENOUGH... "GRACE" is ENOUGH... "YOU" are ENOUGH... Because God IS "ENOUGH"!**

Let God Love You! Live Loved. The Best is Yet to Come. Never Give Up.
