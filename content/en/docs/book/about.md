## Why I Wrote It

My hope with this book is that you give God another chance. Whether you don't think God is real, or can be known or if religious has let you down, it's never too late to give God a try.

## My Story

My story is common to everyone. I have experienced the suffering of mental health (anxiety, depression, obsession, fear), addictions, religion and am here to say no one is beyond healing, rescue, repair in Jesus.

## Who is this book for?

This eBook is for everyone because God invites everyone to the Kingdom.

## TL;DR (Too Long Didn't Read)

* Grace: You are enough. God is enough.
* LET GOD LOVE YOU, LIVE LOVED, LEARN TO LOVE GOD by seeking what matters to God on this earth (Kingdom) and consider God's way of doing things (righteousness). "Seeking the Kingdom of God" is not a religious act. It's a RELATIONAL enterprise. It's an attitude of vulnerability. No religion can teach you that.

### LOVE is ENOUGH...GRACE is ENOUGH...YOU" are ENOUGH...Because God IS ENOUGH!

### Let God Love You! Live Loved. The Best is Yet to Come. Never Give Up.

## Please Share This Message

Once you choose to accept His blessing, He then calls YOU to GO OUT and tell others of the wonderful Kingdom News. This is the test of your gratefulness! If you are passionate about the God who loves you, you will be equally passionate about sharing such blessing with others. May I invite to consider your risk taking adventure. Will people walk into the Kingdom of God because of you? Will you impact someone's life with a more positive view of relationships?

My prayer is that you will choose this moment to follow Him no matter what! Do not be afraid! Only trust Him no matter what! Amen
